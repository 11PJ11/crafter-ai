E2E Acceptance Test: US-003 Post-Execution State Validation (Schema v2.0)

PERSONA: Marcus (Senior Developer)
STORY: As a senior developer, I want DES to automatically detect when phases are
       left abandoned (IN_PROGRESS) after sub-agent completion, so that I'm
       immediately alerted to incomplete work instead of discovering it hours later.

BUSINESS VALUE:
- Detects crashed agents before developers waste debugging time
- Catches silent completions where agent returned without updating state
- Validates execution integrity with specific, actionable error messages
- Enables immediate intervention instead of hours-later discovery

SCOPE: Covers US-003 Acceptance Criteria (AC-003.1 through AC-003.6)
WAVE: DISTILL (Acceptance Test Creation)
STATUS: Migrated to Schema v2.0 (execution-log.yaml format)

TEST BOUNDARY: External protocol (JSON stdin, exit code, JSON stdout).
Tests invoke the hook adapter as a subprocess, matching Claude Code's actual
integration protocol. Internal classes are implementation details.

# All 8 scenarios map to single DEVELOP step:
#   Step: "Implement SubagentStop validation hook"
#
# Each scenario represents a VALIDATION RULE the hook must enforce:
#   - Scenario 1: Hook fires on completion (AC-003.1)
#   - Scenario 2: Abandoned phases detected (AC-003.2)
#   - Scenario 3: Silent completion flagged (AC-003.3)
#   - Scenario 4: Missing outcome detected (AC-003.4)
#   - Scenario 5: Invalid skip detected (AC-003.5)
#   - Scenario 6: Multiple errors with recovery (AC-003.6)
#   - Scenario 7: Clean completion passes (happy path)
#   - Scenario 8: Valid skip passes (happy path)
#
# Recovery Suggestion Quality Requirements:
#   - Each suggestion >= 1 complete sentence (20+ chars)
#   - At least one explains WHY error occurred
#   - At least one explains HOW to fix
#   - Example: "Phase GREEN_UNIT left IN_PROGRESS because agent crashed.
#              Run `/nw:execute @software-crafter steps/01-01.json` to resume."
