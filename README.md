# nWave: Intelligent ATDD Pipeline with Specialized Agent Network

<!-- version: 1.8.0 -->

A systematic approach to software development using ATDD (Acceptance Test Driven Development) with intelligent AI agent orchestration. The framework automates the 6-wave workflow through 26 specialized agents (13 primary + 13 reviewers), each following the Single Responsibility Principle.

## What is nWave?

nWave is an agentic system that guides you through systematic software development:

- **Discover evidence** (DISCOVER phase) - Evidence-based product discovery and market validation
- **Gather requirements** (DISCUSS phase) - Collect business needs with AI assistance
- **Design solutions** (DESIGN phase) - Architecture decisions with visual documentation
- **Define acceptance tests** (DISTILL phase) - BDD scenarios that define "done"
- **Implement with TDD** (DEVELOP phase) - Outside-in development with quality gates
- **Validate production readiness** (DELIVER phase) - Comprehensive quality assurance

Each phase involves specialized AI agents that understand domain-specific best practices.

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation (5 minutes)

```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -O https://github.com/11PJ11/crafter-ai/releases/latest/download/install-nwave-claude-code.py
python3 install-nwave-claude-code.py

# Or from repository
git clone https://github.com/11PJ11/crafter-ai.git nwave
cd nwave
python3 scripts/install/install_nwave.py
```

Full installation details: [Installation Guide](docs/installation/installation-guide.md)

### 2. Your First Development Cycle

```bash
# Build a complete feature with automatic workflow
/nw:develop "Build user authentication system"

# This automatically:
# 1. Baseline: Measure starting state
# 2. Roadmap: Create comprehensive plan
# 3. Split: Break into atomic tasks
# 4. Execute: Run each task with clean context
# 5. Review: Quality gate each step
# 6. Finalize: Archive completed work

# NOTE: /nw:develop is optimized for technical development tasks.
# For features requiring deeper business analysis or design exploration,
# use the manual step-by-step workflow below.
```

Or use the complete workflow with human-in-the-loop control:

```bash
# Full ATDD workflow with human decision points at each stage
# (recommended for complex features, first-time use, or non-technical tasks)
/nw:discover "authentication market research"      # Product discovery
/nw:discuss "authentication requirements"           # Requirements gathering
/nw:design --architecture=hexagonal                # Architecture design
/nw:distill "user-login-story"                     # Acceptance tests
/nw:baseline "implement authentication"             # Measure starting point
/nw:roadmap @solution-architect "implement auth"   # Create plan
/nw:split @devop "auth-implementation"             # Break into tasks
/nw:execute @software-crafter "docs/workflow/..."  # Execute tasks
/nw:review @software-crafter task "docs/workflow/..." # Quality check
```

## Core Concepts

### 6-Wave Workflow (ATDD Pipeline)

```
DISCOVER → DISCUSS → DESIGN → DISTILL → DEVELOP → DELIVER
   ↓         ↓         ↓        ↓         ↓         ↓
Discovery  Requirements  Architecture  Acceptance  Test-First  Feature
Validation Gathering     Design        Tests       Implementation Completion
```

Each stage involves specialized AI agents and produces validated artifacts.

### Agent Organization (26 Agents)

**Core Wave Agents** (one per phase):
- `@product-discoverer` - Evidence-based product discovery (DISCOVER)
- `@product-owner` - Requirements gathering and business analysis (DISCUSS)
- `@solution-architect` - Architecture design with visual diagrams (DESIGN)
- `@acceptance-designer` - BDD scenarios and acceptance tests (DISTILL)
- `@software-crafter` - Outside-in TDD implementation (DEVELOP)
- `@devop` - Production readiness and operations (DELIVER)

**Cross-Wave Specialists** (use anytime):
- `@researcher` - Evidence-based research and analysis
- `@troubleshooter` - Root cause analysis (Toyota 5 Whys)
- `@visual-architect` - Architecture diagrams and visualization
- `@data-engineer` - Database design and query optimization
- `@product-discoverer` - Evidence-based product discovery
- `@agent-builder` - Create and validate new agents
- `@illustrator` - Visual diagrams and design artifacts

**Reviewer Agents** (Layer 4 quality assurance):
- 12 reviewer agents providing peer review with bias detection
- Each reviewer has equal expertise to primary agent
- Structured YAML feedback with severity classification

### Quality Assurance (5-Layer Testing)

```
Layer 1: Unit Testing            - Individual agent output validation
Layer 2: Integration Testing     - Handoff validation between agents
Layer 3: Adversarial Validation  - Challenge output validity
Layer 4: Peer Review             - Equal-expertise reviewer critique ← Unique to nWave
Layer 5: Mutation Testing        - Test suite effectiveness validation ← NEW
```

## Use Cases

### Building New Features (Greenfield)

```bash
/nw:discover "feature market research"
/nw:discuss "feature requirements"
/nw:design --architecture=hexagonal
/nw:distill "acceptance tests"
/nw:baseline "measure starting state"
/nw:roadmap @solution-architect
/nw:split @devop
/nw:execute @software-crafter
/nw:review @software-crafter
```

### Improving Existing System (Brownfield)

```bash
/nw:baseline "current state measurement"        # MANDATORY - blocks roadmap
/nw:roadmap @solution-architect                # Plan while context fresh
/nw:split @devop                               # Break into atomic tasks
/nw:execute @software-crafter                  # Execute with clean context
/nw:review @software-crafter                   # Quality gate
```

### Complex Refactoring

```bash
/nw:baseline "measure starting state"
/nw:roadmap @solution-architect "methodology: mikado"
/nw:split @devop
/nw:execute @software-crafter
# Mikado Method ensures reversibility at every step
```

### Investigating Issues

```bash
/nw:root-why "description of symptom"          # Find root cause (not symptoms)
/nw:develop "fix-issue"                        # Implement fix with TDD
/nw:deliver                                    # Validate production readiness
```

### Research & Learning

```bash
/nw:research "topic or technology"
# Output: docs/research/{category}/{topic}.md
# Then proceed with appropriate job (greenfield, brownfield, etc.)
```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes to Framework

After modifying agents, commands, or framework components:

```bash
# Option 1: Full update (build + install + validate) - Recommended
python scripts/install/update_nwave.py --force

# Option 2: Build only (without installing)
python tools/build.py --clean

# Option 3: Manual install after build
python scripts/install/install_nwave.py
```

### Pre-Commit Hooks

nWave enforces quality gates through pre-commit hooks:

```bash
# Install pre-commit (first time only)
pip install pre-commit
cd nwave
pre-commit install

# Hooks validate automatically on commit:
# - nwave-version-bump: Version consistency
# - pytest-validation: All tests pass (58 tests)
# - docs-version-validation: Documentation stays in sync
# - ruff: Python linting and formatting
# - trailing-whitespace: Removes trailing spaces
# - check-yaml: Validates YAML syntax
```

For emergency bypass (not recommended):
```bash
git commit --no-verify  # Bypasses ALL validation - requires immediate fix
```

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Agents not found after installation?
- Check: [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

**Issue**: Tests failing on commit?
- Run: `pytest` locally to debug
- Ensure: All tests pass before commit

**Issue**: Documentation out of sync with code?
- Run: `pre-commit run --all-files`
- Ensures: Version tags match across tracked files

## Architecture Overview

### Agent Communication

Agents communicate through **file-based handoffs** with structured JSON/YAML:
- Clean context isolation (no accumulated confusion)
- Traceable decisions (audit trail)
- Parallel processing (independent task execution)
- State tracking (TODO → IN_PROGRESS → DONE)

### Framework Configuration

Centralized configuration through:
- `nWave/framework-catalog.yaml` - Command definitions and agent mappings
- `.dependency-map.yaml` - Version tracking and documentation synchronization
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Quality gates

### Quality Gates

Progressive refactoring with validation:
- **L1 Refactoring**: Basic code cleanup
- **L2 Refactoring**: Structure improvements
- **L3 Refactoring**: Design pattern application
- **L4 Refactoring**: Advanced architectural improvements
- **L5-L6 Refactoring**: Major restructuring with comprehensive validation

## Contributing

nWave follows clean architecture principles:
1. Each agent has **one responsibility**
2. Communication through **well-defined interfaces** (JSON/YAML)
3. **Testable code** with 58-test validation suite
4. **Quality gates** at every commit

See individual agent documentation in `nWave/agents/` for implementation details.
