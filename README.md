# AI-Craft: Intelligent ATDD Pipeline with Specialized Agent Network

🚀 **A systematic approach to software development using ATDD (Acceptance Test Driven Development) with intelligent AI agent orchestration**

## 🎯 Overview

AI-Craft is a comprehensive development pipeline that implements the 5-stage ATDD workflow through specialized AI agents, each following the Single Responsibility Principle. The system provides intelligent project analysis, automated workflow initiation, and systematic quality assurance.

### Core Philosophy
- **Outside-In Development**: Start with acceptance tests and work inward
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each agent has one focused responsibility
- **Clean Context Isolation**: Agents receive only essential context for their tasks
- **File-Based Handoffs**: Structured communication between pipeline stages
- **Systematic Quality**: Progressive refactoring and comprehensive validation

## 🏗️ Architecture

## 🎮 Command Interface

### Primary Command: `cai/atdd`
Intelligent ATDD workflow initiation with automatic project analysis:

```bash
# Basic usage - analyze project and start appropriate workflow stage
cai/atdd "implement user authentication system"

# With explicit project analysis
cai/atdd "add payment processing" --analyze-existing

# Start from specific stage
cai/atdd "OAuth2 integration" --from-stage=architect

# Resume existing workflow
cai/atdd --resume auth-feature-2024-01

# Check workflow status
cai/atdd --status
```

### Command Features
- **Intelligent Project Analysis**: Scans existing documentation, tests, and source code
- **Optimal Entry Point Detection**: Determines best starting stage based on project state
- **Context Preparation**: Compiles relevant context for workflow agents
- **Workflow Resumption**: Continue interrupted workflows
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time workflow status and validation

## 🌊 Wave Processing Architecture

### Wave Coordination Principles
1. **Fixed Sequence**: DISCUSS → ARCHITECT → DISTILL → DEVELOP → DEMO (no variations)
2. **Clean Context Isolation**: Each agent starts fresh with only role-specific context
3. **File-Based Handoffs**: Agents communicate through structured output files
4. **Specialized Agent Delegation**: Task tool invokes specific agents with minimal context
5. **Coordinator Oversight**: Monitor progress, validate handoffs, ensure quality gates

### Wave Benefits
- **Context Cleanliness**: No context contamination between stages
- **Focused Expertise**: Each agent works within their domain
- **Quality Gates**: Validation at each stage boundary
- **Resumable Workflows**: Can restart from any completed wave
- **Systematic Progress**: Methodical advancement through development stages

## 🌊 DevOps Three Ways Integration

AI-Craft implements Gene Kim's **Three Ways of DevOps** from "The Phoenix Project":

### First Way: Systems Thinking & Flow
- **ATDD Wave Progression**: Systematic flow from DISCUSS → ARCHITECT → DISTILL → DEVELOP → DEMO
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated pipeline coordination and state management
- **Value Stream Optimization**: Eliminate bottlenecks and optimize delivery flow

### Second Way: Amplify Feedback Loops
- **📊 Observability Agents**: Real-time telemetry collection (metrics, logs, traces)
- **🔍 Performance Monitoring**: Continuous system health assessment
- **👥 User Feedback Integration**: Customer satisfaction and insights analysis
- **⚡ Rapid Response**: Shortened feedback cycles for faster corrective action

### Third Way: Culture of Learning & Experimentation
- **🧪 Experiment-Driven Development**: A/B testing and hypothesis validation
- **📊 Data-Driven Decisions**: Statistical analysis for prioritization
- **🧠 Organizational Learning**: Knowledge synthesis and application
- **🎯 Continuous Optimization**: Strategic priority adjustment based on learning
