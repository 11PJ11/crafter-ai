# Claude Code Model Selection - Executive Summary

## Direct Answer: YES

**Claude Code commands CAN invoke different AI models.**

Individual slash commands and subagents can specify model selection through YAML frontmatter. The feature has been available since v1.0.57 and is fully documented and production-ready.

---

## Current Capabilities

### 1. Slash Command Model Specification ✅

Add `model` field to command YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: review
model: haiku
description: Quick code review
---
```

**Supported values**: `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`, or full model names like `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`

---

### 2. Subagent Model Selection ✅

Add `model` field to agent YAML:

```yaml
---
name: analyzer
model: sonnet
description: Complex analysis
---
```

**Three options**:
- Specific model: `model: opus`
- Inherit session model: `model: inherit`
- Use default: Omit field (defaults to Sonnet)

---

### 3. Session-Level Dynamic Switching ✅

Use `/model` command to switch during session:
- `@claude /model haiku` - immediate switch
- `/model` - interactive menu

---

### 4. Project-Level Defaults ✅

Configure in `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "model": "haiku",
  "testCommand": "npm test"
}
```

---

## What's NOT Possible

❌ **Conditional model selection** - Cannot choose model based on input
❌ **Hook-based routing** - Hooks cannot intercept model selection
❌ **Per-tool model specification** - Model applies to entire command
❌ **Automatic complexity-based selection** - Except for built-in OpusPlan
❌ **Cost tracking** - No built-in cost logging per model

---

## The User's Use Case: FULLY SUPPORTED

**Goal**: Use Haiku for reviews, Sonnet for implementation

**Implementation**:

```yaml
# .claude/commands/review.md
---
name: review
model: haiku
allowed-tools: Read
description: Fast code review
---

Review $ARGUMENTS for issues, bugs, and style violations.
```

```yaml
# .claude/commands/implement.md
---
name: implement
model: sonnet
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Bash
description: Complex implementation
---

Implement $ARGUMENTS with detailed reasoning and explanations.
```

**Result**:
- `/review [file]` → Uses Haiku (fast, cost-efficient)
- `/implement [feature]` → Uses Sonnet (capable, thorough)

## Available Models (October 2025)

| Model | Cost | Speed | Capability | Best For |
|-------|------|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Haiku 4.5** | Lowest | Fastest | High | Quick reviews, high volume |
| **Sonnet 4.5** | Mid | Fast | Highest | Complex coding, general purpose |
| **Opus 4.1** | Highest | Slower | Highest | Specialized complex reasoning |

---

## Implementation Path

1. **Create review command** with `model: haiku`
2. **Create implementation command** with `model: sonnet`
3. **Test model usage** - verify correct models are invoked
4. **Set project defaults** in `.claude/settings.json` if needed
5. **Document** in team guidelines

**Timeline**: Immediate - this feature is available now

---

## Technical Details

**Feature Release**: v1.0.57 (Claude Code)

**Configuration Precedence** (highest to lowest):
1. Session `/model` command
2. Command-line startup flag
3. Environment variables
4. Command frontmatter specification ← **User uses this**
5. Project settings
6. User defaults

**Configuration Level**: Each command independently specifies its model - no global override needed

---

## Knowledge Gaps Identified

1. **Unknown**: Whether session `/model` overrides command-level specification (likely not, but undocumented)
2. **Not Measured**: Performance impact of model switching in single session
3. **Not Documented**: Free-tier model availability (likely all three, but unconfirmed)
4. **Not Available**: Cost tracking per model in Claude Code UI

---

## Recommendation: Immediate Implementation

The user's goal is **fully achievable** with current Claude Code capabilities. No feature development needed, no workarounds required.

**Next Step**: Create command files with model specifications and test.
