# Research: Mikado Method and Progressive Refactoring

**Date**: 2025-10-09T00:00:00Z
**Researcher**: knowledge-researcher (Nova)
**Overall Confidence**: High
**Sources Consulted**: 12+

## Executive Summary

The Mikado Method is a systematic, graph-based approach to planning and executing complex refactoring in existing codebases. Created by Ola Ellnestam and Daniel Brolund, the method addresses the challenge of making large-scale code improvements while keeping the system continuously functional. The methodology uses a visual graph to surface hidden dependencies, break down complex changes into manageable increments, and guide developers through safe transformation sequences. This research synthesizes authoritative sources (2020-2024) on the Mikado Method and its relationship to progressive refactoring techniques including baby steps, opportunistic refactoring, and the Boy Scout Rule.

Key finding: The Mikado Method excels at making "nondestructive" progress on large refactorings by continuously reverting to working states, documenting prerequisites visually, and maintaining shippable code throughout the transformation process. When combined with baby steps TDD and opportunistic refactoring, it provides a complete framework for continuous code improvement.

## Findings

### Finding 1: Mikado Method Core Process

**Evidence**: The method follows a systematic cycle: "1. Set a goal - Define what you want to achieve; 2. Experiment - Try to implement the change; 3. Visualize - In the Mikado method, you'll always visualize your prerequisites, and then undo your breaking changes; 4. Revert - When an experiment for implementing a goal or a prerequisite has broken your system and you have visualized what you need to change in the system to avoid it breaking, you restore the changes you made to a previously working state."

**Confidence**: High

**Verification**: Cross-referenced with:
- [MikadomMethod.info - Official Site](https://mikadomethod.info/)
- [UnderstandLegacyCode - Process to Do Safe Changes](https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/a-process-to-do-safe-changes-in-a-complex-codebase/)

**Analysis**: The four-step cycle embodies the "fail fast, learn, revert" philosophy. Unlike traditional refactoring where developers might spend hours debugging a broken system, the Mikado Method treats compilation/test failures as valuable information sources. Each failure reveals a prerequisite that must be addressed first. The revert step is critical - it keeps the codebase shippable while preserving the learning from the failed experiment in the visual graph.

---

### Finding 2: Mikado Graph Structure

**Evidence**: "Making improvements for large tasks require a nondestructive way forward. The Mikado Method helps you uncover that nondestructive way and keeps you on track even if the effort takes months. The Method creates a Mikado Graph - a visual map showing the goal and all prerequisites needed to achieve it, helping teams maintain progress visibility and work systematically toward complex refactoring objectives."

**Confidence**: High

**Verification**: Cross-referenced with:
- [Medium - Smooth Code Refactors Using the Mikado Method](https://mreigosa.medium.com/smooth-code-refactors-using-the-mikado-method-a69095988718)
- [Vinta Software - Refactoring with Confidence: A Deep Dive](https://www.vintasoftware.com/blog/the-mikado-method)

**Analysis**: The Mikado Graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent goals/subgoals and edges represent dependency relationships. The visualization serves multiple purposes: (1) captures organizational knowledge about system structure, (2) enables parallelization (multiple developers can work on independent branches), (3) provides progress tracking (check off completed nodes), (4) documents the refactoring rationale for future reference. The graph grows organically through experimentation rather than upfront analysis.

---

### Finding 3: Timeboxed Experimentation

**Evidence**: From UnderstandLegacyCode: "Try to achieve the goal within a short timebox (recommended: 10 minutes). If you fail: Revert all changes, identify what's missing, write down subgoals, start again with a subgoal. If you succeed: Commit your changes, check off the goal, move to next unchecked subgoal."

**Source**: [UnderstandLegacyCode - Process to Do Safe Changes in Complex Codebase](https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/a-process-to-do-safe-changes-in-a-complex-codebase/) - Accessed 2025-10-09

**Confidence**: High

**Verification**: Cross-referenced with:
- [Matthias Noback - Successful Refactoring Projects](https://matthiasnoback.nl/2021/02/refactoring-the-mikado-method/)
- [Gitbook - Mikado Method Knowledge Base](https://yoan-thirion.gitbook.io/knowledge-base/software-craftsmanship/code-katas/mikado-method)

**Analysis**: The 10-minute timebox creates urgency and prevents "rabbit hole" refactoring. If you can't make a change work in 10 minutes, it's too complex - break it down further. This aligns with baby steps philosophy: prefer many small, safe transformations over few large, risky ones. The timebox also combats the sunk cost fallacy - after 10 minutes, reverting feels less painful than after hours of work. Teams can adjust the timebox based on context (5 minutes for well-understood code, 15 for exploratory work).

---

### Finding 4: Connection to Baby Steps Refactoring

**Evidence**: Philippe Bourgau describes baby steps: "Baby steps are small increments of working software. The idea is that we test, commit, integrate and even deploy every small code change! Refactoring in baby steps means taking small and safe steps, one at a time, where you start in a green state (the tests are passing), and introduce one single change and run the tests. The Mikado Method is at the heart of making baby steps work in real life."

**Source**: [Philippe Bourgau - Incremental Software Development Strategies #2: Baby Steps](https://philippe.bourgau.net/incremental-software-development-strategies-for-large-scale-refactoring-number-2-baby-steps/) - Accessed 2025-10-09

**Confidence**: High

**Verification**: Cross-referenced with:
- [DEV Community - Refactoring with Baby Steps](https://dev.to/xoubaman/refactoring-with-baby-steps-3mgg)
- [FreeCodecamp - How to Refactor Complex Codebases](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-refactor-complex-codebases/)

**Analysis**: Baby steps and Mikado Method are complementary. Baby steps defines the rhythm (test-commit-integrate frequently), Mikado Method provides the roadmap (which steps to take in which order). The combination enables "always green" refactoring: you're never more than one revert away from a working system. This reduces risk dramatically - if you discover a problem in production, you can quickly revert the last small change rather than untangling hours of work.

---

### Finding 5: Opportunistic Refactoring and Boy Scout Rule

**Evidence**: Martin Fowler describes opportunistic refactoring: "This opportunistic refactoring is often referred to as following the camp site rule - always leave the code behind in a better state than you found it... refactoring should be encouraged as an opportunistic activity, done whenever and wherever code needs to cleaned up - by whoever." Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) formulated the Boy Scout Rule: "Always leave the code better than you found it."

**Source**: [Martin Fowler - Opportunistic Refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OpportunisticRefactoring.html) - Accessed 2025-10-09

**Confidence**: High

**Verification**: Cross-referenced with:
- [Medium - The Boy Scout Rule in Software Development](https://medium.com/@mas-al/the-boy-scout-rule-in-software-development-f94a11c5cfa1)
- [DevIQ - Boy Scout Rule](https://deviq.com/principles/boy-scout-rule/)
- [IN-COM DATA SYSTEMS - Boy Scout Rule: Effortless Refactoring That Scales](https://www.in-com.com/blog/the-boy-scout-rule-the-secret-to-effortless-refactoring-that-scales/)

**Analysis**: Opportunistic refactoring differs from planned refactoring (like Mikado Method) in timing: it happens "along the way" rather than as a dedicated effort. However, the techniques complement each other. Use opportunistic refactoring for small improvements you encounter during feature work. Use Mikado Method when opportunistic improvements reveal a larger structural problem. The Boy Scout Rule makes refactoring a cultural norm rather than a scheduled activity. Key insight from 2024 sources: continuous small improvements prevent technical bankruptcy that would require large-scale refactoring efforts.

---

### Finding 6: Three Types of Refactoring Timing

**Evidence**: From Martin Fowler's bliki: Refactoring occurs at three times: "1. Preparatory refactoring before implementing new functionality; 2. While adding new features (making changes easier); 3. When identifying code duplication or improving class interactions."

**Source**: [Martin Fowler - Opportunistic Refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OpportunisticRefactoring.html) - Accessed 2025-10-09

**Confidence**: High

**Verification**: Cross-referenced with:
- [Codit - Continuous Refactoring](https://www.codit.eu/blog/continuous-refactoring/)
- [LinearB - Refactoring in Agile](https://linearb.io/blog/refactoring-in-agile)

**Analysis**: The three-timing model provides strategic guidance:
1. **Preparatory refactoring**: "Make the change easy, then make the easy change" (Kent Beck). Use Mikado Method here for complex preparatory work.
2. **Concurrent refactoring**: Opportunistic improvements while implementing features. Use Boy Scout Rule.
3. **Comprehension refactoring**: Improving code as you learn its purpose. Capture insights in Mikado graph if they reveal larger patterns.

Understanding these timings helps teams balance refactoring with feature delivery - preparatory refactoring is an explicit investment, concurrent refactoring has near-zero marginal cost.

---

### Finding 7: Behavior-Preserving Transformations

**Evidence**: Multiple sources define refactoring as "behavior-preserving transformation." From Epic Web Dev: "Refactoring is a change of the structure of the code that does not change behavior. True refactoring is only possible when behavior is verified, ideally through automated tests." From LinearB: "Refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior."

**Source**: [Epic Web Dev - 6 Safe Refactorings for Untested Legacy Code](https://www.epicweb.dev/talks/6-safe-refactorings-for-untested-legacy-code) - Accessed 2025-10-09

**Confidence**: High

**Verification**: Cross-referenced with:
- [LinearB - Refactoring in Agile](https://linearb.io/blog/refactoring-in-agile)
- [Debugg.ai - Best Code Refactoring Tools 2024](https://debugg.ai/resources/best-code-refactoring-tools-2024)

**Analysis**: The "behavior-preserving" constraint is fundamental. If you change behavior, you're not refactoring - you're changing requirements. This distinction is crucial for Mikado Method: each step in the graph should preserve behavior at the system level, even if intermediate states don't compile. The safety net for verifying behavior preservation is automated tests, particularly acceptance tests that verify end-to-end behavior. Modern IDEs support many automated refactorings (rename, extract method, etc.) that are provably behavior-preserving.

---

### Finding 8: Automated Refactoring Tool Support

**Evidence**: From 2024 source on refactoring tools: "IntelliJ IDEA is best for Java, Kotlin, and other JVM languages; high productivity and safe refactoring in JetBrains IDEs. Developers turn to specialized refactoring tools to streamline and automate refactoring—ensuring safety and repeatability."

**Source**: [Debugg.ai - Best Code Refactoring Tools 2024](https://debugg.ai/resources/best-code-refactoring-tools-2024) - Accessed 2025-10-09

**Confidence**: High

**Verification**: Cross-referenced with:
- [LinearB - Refactoring in Agile](https://linearb.io/blog/refactoring-in-agile)
- [Epic Web Dev - Safe Refactorings](https://www.epicweb.dev/talks/6-safe-refactorings-for-untested-legacy-code)

**Analysis**: Modern IDEs provide dozens of automated refactorings that are provably safe. Examples: rename symbol, extract method, inline variable, move class. These should be the primary tools for low-level refactoring within a Mikado Method step. Manual refactoring is error-prone; automated refactoring is fast and reliable. However, IDEs can't automate architectural refactorings (e.g., "extract microservice") - this is where Mikado Method adds value by orchestrating many small automated refactorings toward a strategic goal.

---

### Finding 9: Progressive Refactoring Strategy

**Evidence**: From Medium article on progressive refactoring: "Progressive refactoring is a strategy which doesn't block delivering business value, but which helps transitioning your code to a target architecture. Favor an incremental refactoring strategy where teams successfully pull off massive transformations by treating the big refactor as a series of mini-refactors under a shared vision."

**Source**: [Medium - Progressive Refactoring](https://medium.com/@christopheviau/progressive-refactoring-979c2c7e40b1) - Accessed 2025-10-09

**Confidence**: High

**Verification**: Cross-referenced with:
- [This Dot Labs - Incremental Refactoring Using Three Pillars](https://www.thisdot.co/case-study/incremental-refactoring)
- [Philippe Bourgau - Pattern Language for Large Scale Refactoring](https://philippe.bourgau.net/incremental-software-development-strategies-for-large-scale-refactoring-number-4-a-pattern-language/)

**Analysis**: Progressive refactoring addresses the business reality that "stop feature work to refactor" is usually not an option. The strategy involves parallel structure: maintain old architecture while building new, route some traffic/features through new architecture, gradually migrate remaining functionality, remove old architecture. Mikado Method documents this migration path. Key patterns: Strangler Fig (incrementally replace old system), Branch by Abstraction (hide changes behind interface), Feature Toggles (control migration pace).

---

### Finding 10: Mikado Method with TDD Integration

**Evidence**: From Philippe Bourgau's blog: "Mikado Method process with TDD: 1. Add a new failing test; 2. If fix is trivial, resolve immediately; 3. If complex: Comment out test, refactor underlying code, uncomment test, repeat process."

**Source**: [Philippe Bourgau - Baby Steps Strategy](https://philippe.bourgau.net/incremental-software-development-strategies-for-large-scale-refactoring-number-2-baby-steps/) - Accessed 2025-10-09

**Confidence**: High

**Verification**: Cross-referenced with:
- [DEV Community - Refactoring with Baby Steps](https://dev.to/xoubaman/refactoring-with-baby-steps-3mgg)
- [Philippe Bourgau - How to Start Learning Incremental Code Refactoring](https://philippe.bourgau.net/how-to-start-learning-the-tao-of-incremental-code-refactoring-today/)

**Analysis**: Integrating Mikado Method with TDD creates a powerful workflow:
1. Write failing test for desired state (outer loop)
2. Try to make it pass (inner loop)
3. If blocked by architecture, comment out test and start Mikado graph
4. Work through Mikado prerequisites with TDD at each step
5. Uncomment original test - it should now pass

This combines the strategic planning of Mikado Method with the tactical discipline of TDD. The failing test becomes the "goal" node in the Mikado graph. Each prerequisite can have its own TDD cycle.

---

### Finding 11: Continuous Refactoring Culture

**Evidence**: Multiple sources emphasize cultural aspects. From IN-COM DATA: "Without a culture of continuous, incremental refactoring, systems degrade faster than they can evolve. Make small improvements consistently rather than waiting for significant refactoring efforts. If you always make things a little better, then repeated applications will make a big impact that's focused on the areas that are frequently visited."

**Source**: [IN-COM DATA SYSTEMS - Boy Scout Rule](https://www.in-com.com/blog/the-boy-scout-rule-the-secret-to-effortless-refactoring-that-scales/) - Accessed 2025-10-09

**Confidence**: High

**Verification**: Cross-referenced with:
- [Medium - Boy Scout Rule for Better Code](https://medium.com/engineering-managers-journal/the-boy-scout-rule-for-better-code-e6ffda090902)
- [Stepsize - How to be an Effective Boy/Girl-scout Engineer](https://www.stepsize.com/blog/how-to-be-an-effective-boy-girl-scout-engineer)

**Analysis**: Technical practices (Mikado Method, baby steps) require cultural support to be effective. Key cultural elements:
1. **Permission to refactor**: Developers don't need approval for small improvements
2. **Definition of Done includes refactoring**: Not just "feature works" but "code is clean"
3. **Technical debt visibility**: Make architectural problems visible to stakeholders
4. **Celebrate refactoring**: Recognize improvements, not just features

Without these cultural elements, even the best techniques fail. Mikado Method's visibility (the graph) helps communicate refactoring progress to non-technical stakeholders.

### Finding 12: Safe Refactorings for Legacy Code

**Evidence**: Epic Web Dev identifies "6 Safe Refactorings for Untested Legacy Code" that can be applied without test coverage, forming safe initial steps in a Mikado graph for legacy systems.

**Source**: [Epic Web Dev - 6 Safe Refactorings for Untested Legacy Code](https://www.epicweb.dev/talks/6-safe-refactorings-for-untested-legacy-code) - Accessed 2025-10-09

**Confidence**: High

**Verification**: Cross-referenced with:
- [Martin Fowler - Refactoring Catalog](https://refactoring.com/catalog/)
- [Debugg.ai - Best Code Refactoring Tools 2024](https://debugg.ai/resources/best-code-refactoring-tools-2024)

**Analysis**: Legacy code without tests presents a chicken-and-egg problem: refactoring is risky without tests, but adding tests is hard in poorly factored code. Safe refactorings break this cycle. Examples:
1. Rename (using IDE automation)
2. Extract variable (purely local change)
3. Extract method (if tool-supported)
4. Introduce parameter object
5. Remove dead code (found via static analysis)

These can be first nodes in a Mikado graph, creating space to add tests before more invasive refactoring.

## Knowledge Gaps

### Gap 1: Tool Support for Mikado Graphs

**Issue**: While the Mikado Method is well-documented as a paper-and-whiteboard technique, there's limited information about digital tools that support Mikado graph creation, persistence, and team collaboration in 2024.

**Attempted Sources**: General searches for Mikado Method tools (found limited results)

**Recommendation**: Software-crafter agents should document Mikado graphs in version control as simple text files (markdown with task lists) or use general-purpose graph tools (mind maps, flowchart tools). Consider building specialized tooling if Mikado Method becomes a core practice. Graph should be viewable in code review tools to communicate refactoring rationale.

---

### Gap 2: Metrics for Mikado Method Effectiveness

**Issue**: No sources provide quantitative metrics for assessing Mikado Method effectiveness (e.g., "average time to complete refactoring compared to traditional approach" or "defect rate during Mikado-guided refactoring").

**Attempted Sources**: Academic database searches (limited scope)

**Recommendation**: Agents should rely on qualitative assessment: "Did Mikado graph help maintain focus?", "Was code continuously shippable?", "Did team members understand refactoring plan?". Encourage teams to track their own metrics: time in broken state, number of reverts, prerequisites discovered vs. anticipated.

---

### Gap 3: Mikado Method at Different Scales

**Issue**: Most sources discuss Mikado Method for medium-to-large refactorings (weeks to months). Limited guidance on when method is overkill (small refactorings) or insufficient (architectural migrations spanning years).

**Attempted Sources**: Practitioner blogs (some context-specific guidance, no systematic analysis)

**Recommendation**: Provide heuristic guidance: "Use Mikado Method when refactoring spans more than one day but less than one quarter. For shorter work, use simple checklist. For longer work, combine Mikado Method with higher-level architectural planning (ADRs, C4 diagrams)." Emphasize context-dependent judgment.

---

## Conflicting Information

### Conflict 1: Test Coverage as Prerequisite

**Position A**: Refactoring requires comprehensive test coverage as a safety net.
- Source: [LinearB - Refactoring in Agile](https://linearb.io/blog/refactoring-in-agile) - Reputation: Medium-High
- Evidence: "The most trustworthy safety net for refactoring is a suite of automated tests, composed mostly of fast and reliable unit tests"

**Position B**: Some safe refactorings can proceed without tests in legacy code.
- Source: [Epic Web Dev - 6 Safe Refactorings for Untested Legacy Code](https://www.epicweb.dev/talks/6-safe-refactorings-for-untested-legacy-code) - Reputation: High
- Evidence: Identifies specific refactorings (rename, extract variable, etc.) that are safe without test coverage

**Assessment**: Not truly conflicting - positions address different scenarios. Position A describes ideal state for complex refactoring. Position B provides pragmatic path for legacy code. Synthesis: Use safe, automated refactorings to improve code structure until tests can be added, then proceed with more invasive refactoring under test coverage. Mikado Method works in both scenarios - graph simply shows "add test coverage" as a prerequisite node before risky refactorings.

---

### Conflict 2: Refactoring in Feature Branches

**Position A**: Refactoring should be committed immediately (Boy Scout Rule, continuous refactoring).
- Source: [Martin Fowler - Opportunistic Refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OpportunisticRefactoring.html) - Reputation: High
- Evidence: Emphasizes immediate improvement, warns that "another day often doesn't come"

**Position B**: Code review processes may require feature branches, delaying refactoring commits.
- Source: [Software Engineering Stack Exchange - Reconciling Boy Scout Rule with Code Reviews](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/244807/reconciling-the-boy-scout-rule-and-opportunistic-refactoring-with-code-reviews) - Reputation: Medium-High
- Evidence: Discusses tension between immediate commits and review workflows

**Assessment**: This represents a real tension between trunk-based development (favored by XP practitioners) and feature-branch workflows (common in teams using pull requests). Software-crafter agents should acknowledge both approaches:
- **Trunk-based**: Refactoring commits go directly to main branch, extremely short-lived feature branches
- **Feature-branch**: Bundle related refactorings with features, commit refactorings early in branch lifecycle

Recommendation: Favor trunk-based when team has strong CI/CD and test coverage. Use feature branches when team requires review gates but minimize branch lifetime. Never let refactorings languish - either commit immediately (trunk-based) or prioritize review (feature-branch).

---

## Recommendations for Further Research

1. **Mikado Method Tool Development**: Build or identify digital tools that support distributed Mikado graph collaboration, integrate with version control, and provide progress visualization. Ideal features: graph visualization, dependency tracking, GitHub/GitLab integration, team assignment of nodes.

2. **Empirical Effectiveness Studies**: Conduct controlled studies comparing refactoring approaches: Mikado Method vs. upfront planning vs. ad-hoc refactoring. Measure: time to completion, defect introduction rate, time in broken state, developer satisfaction.

3. **Pattern Catalog for Mikado Graphs**: Develop a catalog of common graph patterns for typical refactorings (extract microservice, migrate framework, adopt hexagonal architecture). Each pattern would show typical prerequisites and their ordering.

4. **Integration with Architectural Decision Records**: Research how Mikado graphs relate to ADRs - should completed graphs be archived as ADRs? How can ADRs inform initial Mikado graph structure?

5. **AI-Assisted Prerequisite Discovery**: Explore how static analysis and AI tools could suggest likely prerequisites when starting a Mikado graph, reducing early experimentation time.
