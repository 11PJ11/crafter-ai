# Research Output: Claude Code Model Selection

This directory contains comprehensive evidence-based research on model selection capabilities in Anthropic's Claude Code commands.

---

## Quick Answer

**Can Claude Code commands invoke different models?**

**YES** - Fully supported and documented.

Individual slash commands and subagents specify models via YAML frontmatter. The feature has been available since v1.0.57 and is production-ready.

## Key Findings Summary

### Fully Supported Capabilities ✅

1. **Slash Commands** - Specify model in YAML frontmatter
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: review
   model: haiku
   ---
   ```

2. **Subagents** - Independent model selection per agent
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: analyzer
   model: sonnet
   ---
   ```

3. **Session Control** - Dynamic switching with `/model` command

4. **Project Defaults** - Team-wide configuration in `.claude/settings.json`

5. **Environment Variables** - Global control via `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`

### Use Case Implementation: FULLY SUPPORTED ✅

The user's goal is achievable:

```bash
# Haiku for fast, efficient reviews
@claude /review [file]

# Sonnet for complex implementation
@claude /implement [feature]
```

**Cost Impact**: Estimated 30-40% cost reduction (70% Haiku, 30% Sonnet usage)

## Research Methodology

**Approach**: Evidence-driven research from authoritative sources only

**Sources**:
1. Official Claude Code documentation (docs.claude.com)
2. Official Anthropic engineering blogs
3. GitHub issues and feature discussions
4. Release notes and version history

**Verification**: All major claims cross-referenced with minimum 2 independent sources

**Quality Standards**:
- No speculation, only documented features
- Confidence levels assigned to each finding
- Knowledge gaps explicitly noted where evidence is insufficient
- Full citations provided for all claims

## Available Models (October 2025)

| Model | Cost | Speed | Capability | Release | Best For |
|-------|------|-------|-----------|---------|----------|
| Haiku 4.5 | Lowest | Fastest | High | October 2025 | Reviews, high-volume tasks |
| Sonnet 4.5 | Mid | Fast | Highest | September 2025 | Complex coding, general purpose |
| Opus 4.1 | Highest | Slower | Highest | August 2025 | Specialized complex reasoning |

---

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Implementation (This Week)

1. Create `.claude/commands/review.md` with `model: haiku`
2. Create `.claude/commands/implement.md` with `model: sonnet`
3. Configure `.claude/settings.json` with project defaults
4. Test both commands and verify model selection
5. Document in team guidelines

**Timeline**: 1-2 hours

### For Cost Optimization

1. Analyze current command usage (review vs. implement ratio)
2. Route 60-80% of commands to Haiku
3. Reserve Sonnet for complex work requiring deep reasoning
4. Track cost metrics before/after

**Expected Savings**: 30-40% cost reduction

### For Feature Requests

If you need capabilities beyond current support:

1. **Conditional model selection** - Would require feature development
2. **Automatic complexity-based routing** - Compare with OpusPlan hybrid mode
3. **Cost tracking per model** - Not currently built-in
4. **Per-tool model specification** - Use subagents as workaround

---

## What's NOT Possible

❌ Hooks cannot intercept or modify model selection
❌ Cannot conditionally choose models based on input
❌ Cannot specify different models for different tools within one command
❌ No built-in cost tracking per model

2. **Understand**: Research report (20 min) for deep knowledge
3. **Implement**: Implementation guide (10 min) to get started
4. **Execute**: Create command files using templates provided
5. **Validate**: Test using verification procedures in guide
