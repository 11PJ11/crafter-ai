"""YamlExecutionLogReader - driven adapter for reading execution log data.

Implements the ExecutionLogReader port by reading YAML execution-log files
and converting pipe-delimited event strings into domain PhaseEvent objects.

Infrastructure details (YAML format, file I/O) are hidden behind the port interface.
The application layer only sees PhaseEvent domain objects.
