# nWave Conference Presentation Blueprint
## "The Red Pill: Behavioral-Engineered Agentic AI"

**Conference:** SW Craftsmanship Meetup, Lausanne  
**Date:** January 15, 2026  
**Duration:** 30 minutes intro + live demo  
**Presenters:** Michele Brissoni + Alessandro Di Gioia  
**Format:** Duo presentation (Mike leads intro, Alessandro leads demo)

**Version:** 1.1 (Updated January 11, 2026)  
**Changes:** Added Dojo slide, Timeline slide, and "How Deep" slide before demo

---

## Design Principles

### The Matrix as Argument

The Matrix isn't decoration; it's the critique itself:

| Matrix Element | What It Represents | The Truth |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Green falling code | AI marketing hype | "AI will replace you" |
| The illusion | Productivity promises | Feels fast, actually slower |
| The Matrix itself | The industry narrative | Wealth extraction disguised as progress |
| Being unplugged | nWave reality | Human-first, discipline-first |
| Red pill | The choice | See the system for what it is |

**Critical:** The audience must draw their own conclusions. We show evidence; they connect dots.

### Engagement Architecture

| Tool | Purpose | Signal |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Mentimeter** | Quick polls, temperature checks | QR code on slides |
| **Miro Board** | Parking lot for deep questions | "Park it here" |
| **ELMO** | "Enough, Let's Move On" | Respectful brake |

### Visual Theme

- **Primary palette:** Matrix green (#00FF41) on black
- **Accent:** Red pill red (#FF0000), Blue pill blue (#0000FF)
- **Typography:** Monospace for "code," clean sans-serif for content
- **Animation style:** Digital rain, glitch effects, terminal aesthetics

## Slide-by-Slide Blueprint

---

### SLIDE 1: THE CURTAIN
**Section:** Welcome  
**Duration:** ~2 minutes  
**Purpose:** Entertainment while audience settles; establish the Matrix world

**Visual:**
- Black screen with elegant curtain graphic
- When "opened," reveals the iconic Matrix green code falling
- Title emerges from the code: "nWave"
- Subtitle fades in: "The Red Pill for AI-Assisted Craftsmanship"

**Matrix Quote:** 
> "The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us." — Morpheus

**Speaker Notes:**
[No speaking yet; ambient Matrix soundtrack playing. Code falls. Audience settles. The atmosphere says: "Something different is about to happen."]

**Engagement:** None yet; atmospheric priming

**ChatGPT Visual Prompt Direction:**
- Theatrical red velvet curtain, slightly parted
- Through the gap: Matrix-style falling green code
- Dramatic lighting, cinematic feel
- Text overlay capability for title

---

### SLIDE 2: POWER STATEMENT
**Section:** Purpose + Outcome  
**Duration:** ~1.5 minutes  
**Purpose:** Tell them why they're here and what they'll get

**Visual:**
- Clean dark slide with four key points
- Matrix-style terminal aesthetic
- Each point appears with subtle "typing" animation

**Content:**
```
PURPOSE
Why this talk exists

OUTCOME  
What you'll walk away with

WIIFM
What's in it for you

THE CHOICE
Red pill or blue pill?
```

**Matrix Quote:**
> "I'm trying to free your mind, Neo. But I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it." — Morpheus

**Speaker Notes:**
"Good [morning/afternoon]. Before we begin, let me tell you exactly what the next 30 minutes are about.

**PURPOSE:** We're here to share 7 years of research on AI-assisted software development. Not hype. Not marketing. What actually works; and what doesn't.

**OUTCOME:** You'll leave with a framework for thinking about AI in your craft. Whether you adopt our approach or not, you'll see the landscape differently.

**WIIFM:** If you've felt that something is off about the AI productivity narrative; if you've tried these tools and felt... underwhelmed... you're not crazy. We have the research. We have the data. And we have something that works.

**THE CHOICE:** At the end of this intro, you'll have a choice. But first, let's agree on how we'll work together."

**Engagement:** None yet

---

### SLIDE 3: SOCIAL CONTRACT
**Section:** Engagement Rules  
**Duration:** ~1.5 minutes  
**Purpose:** Establish the interactive framework; create permission to interrupt

**Visual:**
- Split screen: left side shows "rules," right side shows QR codes for Miro + Mentimeter
- Matrix aesthetic continues
- Icons for each tool

**Content:**
```
OUR SOCIAL CONTRACT

🎤 INTERRUPT US
   "Stop me anytime. Challenge anything."

🅿️ PARKING LOT  
   Deep questions → Miro board
   [QR CODE]

📊 QUICK POLLS
   Temperature checks → Mentimeter  
   [QR CODE]

🛑 ELMO
   "Enough, Let's Move On"
   When we need to redirect
```

**Matrix Quote:**
> "There is no spoon." — Spoon Boy
(The rules are what we agree they are)

**Speaker Notes:**
"Here's how this works. This is not a monologue. This is a conversation.

**INTERRUPT US.** Seriously. If something doesn't make sense, if you disagree, if you have a war story; raise your hand. We want that.

**PARKING LOT.** Some questions deserve more time than we have. When that happens, I'll say 'park it.' Drop it in Miro. We'll come back to it during the demo or Q&A.

**MENTIMETER.** We'll run some quick polls. Keep your phone ready.

**ELMO.** This is our safety valve. If a discussion goes off-track, anyone; including you; can call ELMO. 'Enough, Let's Move On.' No offense taken. It keeps us on schedule.

Deal?"

[Wait for nods/agreement]

**Engagement:** 
- Show QR codes
- Ask for verbal agreement on the contract

---

### SLIDE 4: WHO WE ARE
**Section:** Credibility  
**Duration:** ~3 minutes  
**Purpose:** Establish credibility without bragging; human connection

**Visual:**
- Two portrait placeholders (Matrix-style treatment: green tint, code overlay)
- Brief credentials beneath each
- Clean, not cluttered

**Content:**
```

```

**Matrix Quote:**
> "I know kung fu." — Neo
(After years of learning)

**Speaker Notes:**
**MIKE:**
"I'm Mike. Behavioral engineer. I've spent 22 years asking one question: 'Why can't software development operate at the level of excellence I saw in Formula 1 engineering?'

That question led to the SW Craftsmanship Dojo; a framework that's transformed over 15,000 developers across companies like IBM, UniCredit, Coca-Cola, and many others.

For the last 7 years, that same question applied to AI: 'Can AI make craftspeople better? Or does it just make us faster at being mediocre?'

**ALESSANDRO:**
[Alessandro introduces himself; ~1 minute]"

**Engagement:** None; listening mode

**Note:** Alessandro needs to provide his bio content

### SLIDE 5: TWO TRAJECTORIES, ONE DESTINATION
**Section:** Why Together  
**Duration:** ~2 minutes  
**Purpose:** Show convergence; this isn't one person's pet project

**Visual:**
- Two parallel paths (like the red/blue pill choice) converging
- Timeline aesthetic
- Converge point: "SW Craftsmanship Dojo"

**Content:**

```

**Matrix Quote:**
> "What happened, happened, and couldn't have happened any other way." — Morpheus

**Speaker Notes:**
"Why are we presenting this together?

Because nWave isn't my idea that Alessandro helped with, or his idea that I helped with. It's what happens when two separate research tracks; both asking the same fundamental question; collide and synthesize.

[Quick version of convergence story]

The point is: this framework has been stress-tested from multiple angles. It's not theory. It's battle-tested practice."

**Engagement:** None

**Note:** Alessandro fills in his trajectory

### SLIDE 6: THE SW CRAFTSMANSHIP DOJO®
**Section:** The Foundation  
**Duration:** ~2 minutes  
**Purpose:** Establish what we built for humans before applying it to AI

**Visual:**
- Dojo logo/brand treatment in Matrix style
- Key metrics displayed (15,000+, 14 years, 150 KBIs)
- Client logos or impact visualization
- Belt progression system hint

**Content:**
```
THE SW CRAFTSMANSHIP DOJO®

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

This is what we built for HUMANS.
The question became: Can we apply this to AI?
```

**Matrix Quote:**
> "I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it." — Morpheus

**Speaker Notes:**
"When our paths converged, this is what emerged: The SW Craftsmanship Dojo.

14 years of refinement. Over 15,000 developers transformed. Companies like IBM, UniCredit, Coca-Cola, KTM, Netherlands Railways.

The core insight was simple but powerful: **behavior can be observed, cataloged, and made predictable.** We created 150 Key Behavior Indicators; observable traits that distinguish a craftsperson from a coder.

Teams went from low-performing to high-performing on the DORA metrics. Manual deployments became single-click. Fear-filled releases became routine.

This is what we built for humans. And then the question that opened everything:

**Can we apply this same framework to AI?**"

**Engagement:** None; foundational context

**Matrix Quote:**
> "What happened, happened, and couldn't have happened any other way." — Morpheus

**Speaker Notes:**
"Before we dive deeper, let me give you the map.

[Point to timeline as you speak]

2003: The F1 encounter that started the question.

2011 to 2020: The Dojo evolves through UniCredit and IBM.

2019: A branch opens. We start experimenting with AI tools. Kite, Sourcery, Tab9.

2022: ChatGPT arrives. We try prompt engineering. It works for some things, fails for others.

2023-2024: We observe what Karpathy will later call 'vibe coding.' We see it failing before the research confirms it.

Meanwhile, on a parallel track, we're evolving Vera; applying behavioral specs to AI identity.

2025: The tracks converge. Alessandro joins. Mutation testing clicks. Everything crystallizes.

January 2026: Here we are. nWave.

Now let's walk through what we learned at each stage."

**Engagement:** 
- Reference the timeline throughout remaining slides
- "Remember where we are on the map"

### SLIDE 8: THE CORE THESIS
**Section:** The Argument  
**Duration:** ~1.5 minutes  
**Purpose:** Plant the central idea; everything else supports this

**Visual:**
- Large, bold statement
- Matrix green on black
- Simple, no distraction

**Content:**
```
AI IS AN AMPLIFIER

It magnifies whatever patterns exist.

Excellence → 4× multiplier
Dysfunction → 4× disaster

The question isn't "Will you use AI?"
The question is: "What are you amplifying?"
```

**Matrix Quote:**
> "There's a difference between knowing the path and walking the path." — Morpheus

**Speaker Notes:**
"Here's the thesis. Everything we're going to show you supports this one idea:

**AI is an amplifier.**

It doesn't create excellence. It doesn't create dysfunction. It magnifies whatever patterns already exist in your team, your codebase, your product clarity.

If you have elite technical practices and clear product vision; AI becomes a 4× force multiplier.

If you have weak practices and fuzzy requirements; AI helps you build the wrong thing faster. And it feels productive while it's happening.

This is the trap. And almost everyone is falling into it."

**Engagement:** 
- Possible Mentimeter: "What do you think AI amplifies most in your team?"
  - A) Speed
  - B) Quality  
  - C) Technical debt
  - D) Confusion

---

### SLIDE 9: 2019 — THE BRANCH OPENS
**Section:** Journey Start  
**Duration:** ~1.5 minutes  
**Purpose:** Set the timeline; they're entering a 7-year story

**Visual:**
- Timeline graphic
- 2019 highlighted
- Early AI tools: Kite, Sourcery, Tab9
- "The question that opened a new branch"

**Content:**
```
2019: THE BRANCH OPENS

While the Dojo continued for humans...
A new question emerged:

"Can AI technology fit the software development lifecycle
not just for normal development,
but for a CRAFTER?"

Early tools: Kite • Sourcery • Tab9
Limited, but... intriguing.
```

**Matrix Quote:**
> "You take the red pill... and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes." — Morpheus

**Speaker Notes:**
"2019. The Dojo is mature. We've transformed thousands of developers. And a new question starts nagging:

'What if we could apply behavioral engineering to AI itself?'

Not 'Can AI write code?' That's the wrong question.

'Can AI become a collaborator that operates within the same behavioral bounds as a reliable craftsperson?'

We started experimenting with early tools. Kite. Sourcery. Tab9. They were limited; more pattern matchers than true AI. But they opened a door.

For the next 5 years, we walked through that door. And what we found was... not what we expected."

**Engagement:** None

---

### SLIDE 10: PROMPT ENGINEERING — THE PROMISE
**Section:** What Worked, What Broke  
**Duration:** ~2 minutes  
**Purpose:** Show the first major crossroad; acknowledge what's useful

**Visual:**
- Split screen: "What Worked" (green check) vs. "What Failed" (red X)
- Terminal/code aesthetic

**Content:**
```
PROMPT ENGINEERING (2022-2023)

✓ WHAT WORKED                    ✗ WHAT FAILED
─────────────────                ─────────────────
Design thinking partner          Predictable code
Content creation                 Consistent outputs  
Divergent exploration            Behavioral engineering
Generating raw materials         Reliable workflows
                                 
"Useful for the periphery.       
 Failed for the core."

THE PROBLEM: Indeterminate results.
Same prompt → different outputs.
You cannot build reliable systems on sand.
```

**Matrix Quote:**
> "Throughout human history, we have been dependent on machines to survive. Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony." — Morpheus

**Speaker Notes:**
"When ChatGPT dropped, we were excited. We fed it everything; the entire Dojo curriculum, every book, every research paper.

For certain things, it was magic:
- Divergent exploration? Brilliant.
- Content creation? Huge productivity boost.
- Generating brownfield code for refactoring exercises? Perfect.

But for what we actually needed; predictable, reliable code generation; it fell apart.

**The fundamental problem:** The same prompt produces different outputs. Every time.

Our entire behavioral engineering framework is built on one premise: behavior can be observed, cataloged, and made predictable. If AI can't be predictable, we can't engineer it.

Prompt engineering for coding was a dead end. We hit the wall."

**Engagement:** None

### SLIDE 11: VIBE CODING — THE TRAP
**Section:** The Industry Mistake  
**Duration:** ~2 minutes  
**Purpose:** Name the phenomenon; validate their experience

**Visual:**
- The Matrix code falling, but glitching/corrupting
- Karpathy tweet reference (stylized, not screenshot)
- "The trap" visualized

**Content:**
```
VIBE CODING: THE TRAP (2023-2025)

February 2025: Andrej Karpathy names it.
The industry celebrates.

"I just mass accept whatever Copilot suggests...
 I give up on understanding every line."

THE PATTERN WE OBSERVED:
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  The more you talk with AI,           │
│  the more hallucinated the code.      │
│                                        │
│  Context drift → Error compounding    │
│  Wide scope → High hallucination      │
│  "Legacy at conception"               │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘

We saw this in 2023.
Research confirmed it in 2024-2025.
```

**Matrix Quote:**
> "Have you ever had a dream, Neo, that you were so sure was real? What if you were unable to wake from that dream? How would you know the difference between the dream world and the real world?" — Morpheus

**Speaker Notes:**
"Then something interesting happened. Tools got better. Much better. And a new pattern emerged.

February 2025: Andrej Karpathy; one of the founding figures of modern AI; tweets about 'vibe coding.' Just accept whatever the AI suggests. Don't try to understand it. Just... vibe.

The industry loved it. Finally, AI was going to make everyone a 10× developer!

Except... we'd been watching this pattern in the Dojo since 2023. Students trying to use AI to pass tests. And we noticed something:

**The more they talked with AI, the worse the code got.**

Context drift. Error compounding. Wide scopes producing hallucinated architectures. Code that was born as legacy.

This wasn't a feature. It was a trap.

And the research started confirming what we'd observed."

**Engagement:**
- Possible Mentimeter poll: "Have you experienced vibe coding?"
  - A) Yes, and it worked great
  - B) Yes, and it felt productive but the code was questionable
  - C) Yes, and I rolled it back
  - D) I haven't tried it
  - E) What's vibe coding?

### SLIDE 12: THE RESEARCH SPEAKS
**Section:** Evidence  
**Duration:** ~2 minutes  
**Purpose:** Ground claims in data; this isn't opinion

**Visual:**
- Research logos/citations (DORA, Stanford, METR, GitClear)
- Key statistics highlighted
- Clean data presentation

**Content:**
```
THE RESEARCH SPEAKS (2024-2025)

DORA State of DevOps
├─ 7.2% decrease in delivery stability with AI
├─ 1.5% decrease in delivery throughput with AI  
└─ 39% report low/no trust in AI-generated code

Stanford SWEPR (120,000+ developers)
├─ Net average: 15-20% productivity improvement
├─ BUT: Experienced devs in complex codebases → NEGATIVE impact
└─ Gap between top and bottom teams is WIDENING

METR Randomized Controlled Trial
├─ Developers BELIEVED AI saved 24% time
├─ Developers ESTIMATED AI saved 20% time
└─ ACTUAL MEASUREMENT: AI increased time by 19%

"The perception-reality gap is real."
```

**Matrix Quote:**
> "What you know you can't explain, but you feel it. You've felt it your entire life." — Morpheus
(That feeling that something is wrong with the AI narrative)

**Speaker Notes:**
"Now, we're not asking you to trust our observations. Let's look at the research.

**DORA**; the most respected source on DevOps performance; found that AI adoption correlates with *decreased* delivery stability and throughput. Not increased. Decreased.

**Stanford** surveyed 120,000 developers across 600 companies. Yes, there's a net productivity gain; 15-20%. But experienced developers working on complex codebases see *negative* impact. And the gap between top-performing and bottom-performing teams is getting wider.

**METR** ran a rigorous randomized controlled trial. Developers *believed* they were 24% faster with AI. They *estimated* they were 20% faster. The actual measurement? They were **19% slower**.

And here's the kicker: 69% kept using AI *after* being shown the data.

The perception-reality gap is real. The Matrix is comfortable. Waking up is hard."

**Engagement:** 
- Let this sink in
- Invite reactions: "Does this match your experience?"

### SLIDE 13: THE PARADIGM FLIP
**Section:** The Turning Point  
**Duration:** ~2 minutes  
**Purpose:** Show the reframe that changed everything

**Visual:**
- Before/After comparison
- "Wrong question → Right question" format
- Vera evolution (v1.0 → v4.0) visual timeline

**Content:**
```
THE PARADIGM FLIP

WRONG QUESTION (2019-2023):
"Can AI learn craftsmanship?"

RIGHT QUESTION (2023-2025):
"Can I apply behavioral engineering TO the AI itself?"

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Not: Train AI to be consistent                 │
│       (impossible; LLMs are stochastic)         │
│                                                 │
│  Instead: SPECIFY and CONSTRAIN behavior        │
│           within tolerable variance             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

The same framework built for humans;
observable behaviors, predictable patterns,
iterative refinement;
applied to AI.

The result: Vera v1.0 → v2.0 → v3.0 → v4.0
```

**Matrix Quote:**
> "I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it." — Morpheus

**Speaker Notes:**
"Here's where everything changed.

We were asking the wrong question. 'Can AI learn craftsmanship?' implies training the AI to be consistent. But LLMs are stochastic by nature. You can't make them deterministic.

The right question: 'Can I apply behavioral engineering TO the AI?'

Same framework. Same principles. Different subject.

Instead of hoping the model would be consistent, we started specifying: defining expected behaviors and forging them through repetition.

The result was Vera; our AI collaborator; evolving through four major versions. Each iteration refined by the same rapid feedback loop we use in the Dojo.

This is when the second track of our research merged with the first. Spec-driven development... but for AI behavior."

**Engagement:** None; let the reframe land

### SLIDE 14: BOUNDED VARIANCE
**Section:** The Key Insight  
**Duration:** ~2 minutes  
**Purpose:** Explain the core technical concept accessibly

**Visual:**
- Graph showing variance ranges
- Human variance band vs. AI variance (before/after constraints)
- "Tolerable variance" zone highlighted

**Content:**
```
BOUNDED VARIANCE

The reframe that unlocked everything:

"Can we constrain AI's variance to be within
 the same tolerance range as a reliable
 human colleague?"

If AI variance ≤ Human variance → Reliable collaboration
```

**Matrix Quote:**
> "What is 'real'? How do you define 'real'?" — Morpheus
(We don't need perfect. We need bounded.)

**Speaker Notes:**
"Summer 2025. Alessandro and I are deep in discussion. We keep hitting the same wall: AI is non-deterministic. How do we build reliable systems on non-deterministic components?

Then the reframe:

Humans aren't deterministic either. A senior developer doesn't write identical code every time. But they operate within a bounded range of predictable behavior. Their variance is tolerable.

What if we could constrain AI to that same range?

Not perfection. Not determinism. Just: variance within tolerance.

That became the engineering target. And it changed everything."

### SLIDE 15: THE THREE LAYERS
**Section:** Technical Architecture (Simplified)  
**Duration:** ~2 minutes  
**Purpose:** Show HOW variance is constrained; the quality stack

**Visual:**
- Three stacked layers diagram
- Each layer labeled with mechanism and purpose
- Pyramid or containment visual

**Content:**
```
THE THREE-LAYER ERROR CONTAINMENT

LAYER 1: PERSONALITY VARIANCE
├─ Mechanism: Single Responsibility
├─ One agent = One role, One scope, One artifact
└─ Prevents context drift and multi-hat confusion

LAYER 2: ARTIFACT VARIANCE  
├─ Mechanism: Contract Testing (Template as Schema)
├─ Artifacts must fulfill a template
└─ Format compliance = machine-verifiable

LAYER 3: ERROR COMPOUNDING
├─ Mechanism: Adversarial Review (Quality Gate)
├─ Third-party agent validates compliance
└─ Cannot proceed until reviewer approves

+ THE FINAL GATE: MUTATION TESTING
  "The ace in the pocket."
```

**Matrix Quote:**
> "It is inevitable." — Agent Smith
(The quality gates are relentless)

**Speaker Notes:**
"Here's how it works. Three layers of error containment, plus a final verification gate.

**Layer 1:** Each agent has one role, one scope, one artifact. Single responsibility. No context drift. No confused multi-tasking.

**Layer 2:** Every artifact must match a template. The content can vary; human-like variance. But the format is strict; machine-verifiable.

**Layer 3:** Every producer has a reviewer. A third-party agent that checks: 'Does this comply? Is it congruent?' The reviewer doesn't care *why* the producer made something. Only whether it passes the gate.

And then there's the ace in the pocket: **mutation testing**.

Coverage is a vanity metric if tests don't verify behavior. Mutation testing mutates the code and checks if tests catch it. If they don't, the tests are fake.

This gate cannot be cheated. The agents can't game it. The tests can't lie."

**Engagement:** None

**Speaker Notes:**
"This is nWave.

At the top: **The One**; the human director. Sets the compass. Makes the choices that matter. You cannot automate intent.

Below: **The Oracle**; Vera; who guides and orchestrates. The bastian contrario who challenges before you move.

Then: **The Crews**; 5 waves of work. Discuss. Design. Distill. Develop. Deliver. Each wave has agents. Riley gathers requirements. Morgan designs architecture. Quinn writes acceptance tests. Crafty implements with outside-in TDD. Dakota validates production readiness.

And at every gate: **The Agents**; reviewers who are relentless, multiplying, inevitable. Like Agent Smith. They don't care about excuses. They care about compliance.

28 agents. 14 producers. 14 reviewers. Human-directed. AI-executed. Quality-verified.

This is what we're going to show you."

**Speaker Notes:**
"So here we are.

You've seen the journey. 7 years. Dead ends. Breakthroughs. Research that validates what we observed.

Now you have a choice.

**Blue pill:** Go back to the Matrix. Keep using AI the way vendors tell you. Hope the productivity gains materialize. Ignore the research.

**Red pill:** See how deep this goes. Watch the agents work. See the quality gates trigger. Watch mutation testing catch what coverage alone cannot.

But before we show you... let me tell you how deep this rabbit hole really goes."

**Engagement:** 
- The choice is rhetorical but powerful
- Possible Mentimeter: "Red pill or blue pill?" (anonymous poll)
- Transition music/sound effect?

This isn't just about being better developers.
It's about being LEGAL developers.
```

**Matrix Quote:**
> "Remember... all I'm offering is the truth. Nothing more." — Morpheus

**Speaker Notes:**
"Before we go to the demo, let me show you how deep this goes.

**AI-Readiness Assessment.**

You can't amplify excellence if you don't know what you're starting with. We've built an assessment tool; open source, available today; that diagnoses your team's readiness for AI-assisted development.

It measures your technical practices, your product clarity, your team's behavioral baseline. It gives you a score and recommendations.

Because here's the truth: if your score is low, adding AI makes things worse, not better. You need to fix the foundation first.

[Show QR code]

**EU AI Act.**

This isn't optional anymore. As of February 2025, human oversight of AI systems is law in Europe. The regulation requires:
- Proven competence to supervise
- Authority to intervene
- Time and focus for oversight
- Mastery to guide AI

nWave isn't just better engineering. It's compliant engineering. Human-directed by architecture, not by policy memo.

Now... let's see it work."
