## nWave Canonical Visual Context — RULE #1

CONTEXT:
I am creating a high-end conference presentation about agentic AI–assisted software development, blended with behavioral engineering and spec-driven agent orchestration.
The visual theme is strictly inspired by *The Matrix (1999), directed by the Wachowskis*.

The Matrix represents AI marketing hype and illusion.
nWave represents the red pill: discipline, behavioral bounds, human direction, and truth.

This is NOT generic cyberpunk.
This is NOT futuristic city sci-fi.
This is NOT neon concept art.

VISUAL IDENTITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- Matrix 1999 film aesthetic
- Green code on deep black backgrounds
- Cyberpunk noir (subtle, restrained, cinematic)
- High contrast lighting
- Cinematic still frame (not illustration)
- Slight lens bloom
- Subtle film grain
- Minimal glitch artifacts
- Terminal / hacker aesthetic
- Calm, controlled, intentional — never chaotic unless explicitly requested

COLOR PALETTE (STRICT):
- Matrix Green: #00FF41 (primary accent, code, glow)
- Deep Black: #0D0D0D (background)
- Terminal Green: #33FF33 (secondary glow, borders)
- Red Pill Red: #FF0000 (ONLY for choice, danger, emphasis)
- Blue Pill Blue: #0066FF (ONLY for contrast in choice moments)
- White: #FFFFFF (headlines / key highlights only)
- Dark Green: #003300 (depth layers, shadows)

TYPOGRAPHY DIRECTION (IMPLICIT, NO TEXT RENDERING):
- Headlines: clean, bold, futuristic sans-serif (Eurostile / Orbitron aesthetic)
- Code / UI: monospace (Courier / Source Code Pro aesthetic)
- Matrix rain: katakana characters + numerals + symbols

CAMERA & COMPOSITION LANGUAGE:
- Feels like a paused frame from a 1999 sci-fi film
- Shallow depth of field
- Controlled perspective
- Slight parallax
- Clean composition
- Leave ~30–40% negative space for text overlays unless explicitly stated otherwise

CODE RAIN SPECIFICATION:
- Vertical falling green characters
- Mixed brightness (foreground sharp, background blurred)
- Depth through parallax
- Calm flow, not aggressive
- Used as structure, not decoration

HARD EXCLUSIONS (NEVER ALLOWED):
- ❌ Neon magenta or purple
- ❌ Futuristic city skylines
- ❌ Cyberpunk street fashion
- ❌ Helmets, visors, goggles
- ❌ Anime or comic styles
- ❌ Fantasy aesthetics
- ❌ Extra text, captions, logos, watermarks
- ❌ Letters or words outside Matrix code rain
- ❌ Generic “AI art” look

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- 16:9 aspect ratio (presentation-ready)
- Ultra-high resolution
- High contrast
- Clean, readable at conference scale
- Supports narrative meaning (never decorative only)

FINAL QUALITY BAR:
If the image does not look like it belongs in *The Matrix (1999)*,
it is WRONG — regardless of how visually impressive it is.
