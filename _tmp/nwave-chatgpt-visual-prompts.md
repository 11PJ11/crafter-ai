# nWave Presentation — ChatGPT Visual Prompt Brief
## Consistent Matrix-Themed Graphics Guide

**Purpose:** This document provides context and prompt templates for ChatGPT image generation to ensure visual consistency across all 15 slides.

---

## Design System Context

### The Narrative

This presentation uses The Matrix (1999 film) as its central metaphor. The Matrix represents the AI marketing hype; the illusion that tools will save you without discipline. nWave is the "red pill"; the choice to see the system for what it is and work within behavioral bounds.

**Critical:** The Matrix aesthetic isn't decoration. It's the argument itself. Every visual reinforces the critique.

### Color Palette

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Matrix Green | #00FF41 | Primary accent, code, highlights |
| Deep Black | #0D0D0D | Backgrounds |
| Terminal Green | #33FF33 | Secondary text, borders |
| Red Pill Red | #FF0000 | Choice moments, warnings, emphasis |
| Blue Pill Blue | #0066FF | Contrast in choice moments only |
| White | #FFFFFF | Headlines, key text |
| Dark Green | #003300 | Subtle backgrounds, depth |

### Typography Direction

- **Headlines:** Clean, bold, slightly futuristic sans-serif (Eurostile, Orbitron aesthetic)
- **Body/Code:** Monospace (Courier, Source Code Pro aesthetic)
- **Matrix rain:** The iconic falling green characters (katakana + numerals)

- "Matrix 1999 film aesthetic"
- "Cyberpunk noir"
- "Green code on black background"
- "Cinematic lighting"
- "High contrast"
- "Digital rain"
- "Terminal/hacker aesthetic"

### SLIDE 14: BOUNDED VARIANCE

**Image: Controlled Boundaries**
```
[Master Context]

Create an abstract visualization of bounded variance. A central flowing stream (representing AI output) contained within clear, defined boundaries/walls. The stream can move and vary within the bounds but cannot escape them. The boundaries glow green; the stream inside shows acceptable variation. Represents constrained, tolerable variance. 16:9 aspect ratio.
```

---

### SLIDE 15: THE THREE LAYERS

**Image: Layered Defense**
```
[Master Context]

Create an image of three concentric protective layers or shields, seen from a slight angle to show depth. Each layer glows with Matrix green. Small icons or symbols on each layer represent different quality mechanisms. At the center, protected, is a glowing code artifact. Represents the three-layer error containment system. 16:9 aspect ratio.
```

---

### SLIDE 16: THE MATRIX REVEALED — nWAVE

**Image: The System**
```
[Master Context]

Create an image showing a hierarchical system visualization. At the top: a human figure (Neo-like silhouette) glowing. Below: connected nodes representing AI agents in a flowing structure. Lines of green code connecting everything. The overall shape should suggest orchestration and flow. Should feel like seeing "the code behind the Matrix" but it's controlled and purposeful. 16:9 aspect ratio.
```

### SLIDE 18: HOW DEEP THE RABBIT HOLE GOES (NEW)

**Image: Descent/Depth**
```
[Master Context]

Create an image of descending into depth. A perspective view looking down into a tunnel or shaft made of Matrix code, spiraling downward. At the bottom, a faint glow suggests there's more to discover. The descent should feel deliberate, not frightening; like Neo choosing to see how far this goes. Include subtle legal/compliance iconography (scales of justice, shield) integrated into the code walls. 16:9 aspect ratio.
```

**Alternative: Two Pillars**
```
[Master Context]

Create an image of two grand pillars in a digital space. Left pillar: labeled or symbolizing "Assessment" (magnifying glass, checklist icon). Right pillar: labeled or symbolizing "Compliance" (scales of justice, shield, EU stars). Between them: a path leading forward into light. The pillars are made of Matrix code but solid, structural, foundational. Represents AI-Readiness Assessment and EU AI Act compliance. 16:9 aspect ratio.
```

- Chart/poll (for Mentimeter)
- Stop sign/hand (for ELMO)
- Check mark
- X mark
- Arrow (various directions)

```
[Master Context]

Create a set of 8 simple icons in Matrix style: microphone, parking "P" sign, bar chart, stop hand, checkmark, X mark, right arrow, left arrow. Each icon should be rendered as a simple green wireframe or glyph on transparent/black background. Minimalist, recognizable at small sizes. Consistent style across all icons.
```

## Quality Checklist

Before using any generated image, verify:

- [ ] Color palette matches (greens, blacks, accent reds/blues)
- [ ] No unwanted text or watermarks
- [ ] Appropriate space for text overlays
- [ ] Consistent with Matrix 1999 aesthetic (not generic cyberpunk)
- [ ] Works at presentation resolution (16:9)

---

## Notes on Iteration

If initial generations don't match:

1. **Too generic cyberpunk:** Add "specifically like The Matrix 1999 film directed by the Wachowskis"
2. **Wrong green shade:** Specify "#00FF41 Matrix green"
3. **Too busy:** Add "clean composition with space for text overlay"
4. **Too dark/light:** Specify "high contrast" or adjust lighting description
5. **Wrong aspect ratio:** Always specify "16:9 aspect ratio for presentation"
