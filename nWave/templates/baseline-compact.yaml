# Compact Baseline Template - Minimal Required Structure
# Use this template for feature_development | performance_optimization | process_improvement

baseline:
  project_id: "{kebab-case-id}"  # Must match docs/features/{project-id}/
  created_at: "{ISO-8601}"
  type: "feature_development"  # or performance_optimization | process_improvement
  feature: "{1-sentence description}"

# Measurements: compact array format (one metric per entry)
measurements:
  - name: "{metric_1}"
    current: {value}
    target: {value}
    unit: "{unit}"
    method: "{reproducible measurement command}"
  - name: "{metric_2}"
    current: {value}
    target: {value}
    unit: "{unit}"
    method: "{reproducible measurement command}"

# User stories (feature_development only, omit for other types)
user_stories:
  US-001: {tests: 3, passing: 0, components: 0, target_components: 2}
  US-002: {tests: 5, passing: 0, components: 0, target_components: 3}

# Dependencies between user stories or components
dependencies:
  - "{US-XXX} → {US-YYY}: {reason}"

# Validation section
validation:
