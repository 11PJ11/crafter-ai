# Execution Log Template (Append-Only)
#
# Orchestrator copies this file to docs/feature/{project-id}/execution-log.yaml
# and populates the header fields.
#
# Design:
# - Header: Written ONCE by orchestrator when feature starts
# - Events: APPEND-ONLY by agent after each phase (NO re-reads!)
#
# Event Format: step_id|phase|status|data|timestamp
# - step_id: Step identifier (e.g., "01-01")
# - phase: TDD phase name from step-tdd-cycle-schema.json
# - status: EXECUTED or SKIPPED
# - data: PASS/FAIL for EXECUTED, PREFIX:reason for SKIPPED
# - timestamp: ISO 8601 format
#
# Token Efficiency: ~15 tokens per event vs ~500 for nested structures

project_id: ""        # Set by orchestrator (e.g., "auth-upgrade")
created_at: ""        # ISO 8601 timestamp
total_steps: 0        # Number of steps from roadmap.yaml

# Event log (append-only)
# Agent appends one line per phase: echo '  - "step|phase|status|data|ts"' >> file
events: []
