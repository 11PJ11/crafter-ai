# DW-MUTATION-TEST: Feature-Scoped Mutation Testing

**Wave**: QUALITY_GATE
**Agent**: Crafter (nw-software-crafter)

## Overview

Run mutation testing against implementation files from the current feature. Extracts targets from execution-log.yaml, generates feature-scoped configs, and delegates execution to the software-crafter agent. Uses cosmic-ray (Python), PIT (Java), or Stryker (JS/TS/C#).

## Context Files Required

- `docs/feature/{project-id}/execution-log.yaml` - Implementation file extraction
- `scripts/mutation/generate_scoped_configs.py` - Automated config generation (if available)

## Pre-Invocation

The orchestrator performs these steps before delegating:

1. Read `execution-log.yaml` and extract implementation files from `completed_steps[].files_modified.implementation`
2. Verify all extracted files exist on disk
3. Detect project language from config files (pyproject.toml, pom.xml, package.json, etc.)
4. Confirm test suite passes: run `pytest -x {test_scope}` (or equivalent)
5. Ensure mutation venv exists for Python: `.venv-mutation/` with cosmic-ray installed

## Agent Invocation

@nw-software-crafter

Execute mutation testing for project {project-id}.

**Context to pass inline (the agent has no Skill access):**

- Project ID
- Implementation file list (extracted from execution-log.yaml)
- Test scope path (e.g., `tests/des/`)
- Kill rate threshold (default: 80%)
- Language and tool selection

**Configuration:**

- threshold: 80 (percentage, minimum kill rate)
- approach: feature-scoped (one config per component, scoped test commands)
- config_generator: `scripts/mutation/generate_scoped_configs.py` (preferred over manual)

**Task boundary constraints for agent prompt:**

- Run mutation testing and produce report only
- Do not modify production code
- Do not proceed to finalize
- Use file-list module-path, not directory-based
- Return control to orchestrator after completion

**Output file:** `docs/feature/{project-id}/mutation/mutation-report.md`

## Examples

### Example 1: Python project with config generator

```bash
/nw:mutation-test des-hook-enforcement tests/des/
```

Orchestrator reads execution-log.yaml, runs `generate_scoped_configs.py des-hook-enforcement`, delegates to software-crafter with per-component configs. Agent runs cosmic-ray, produces mutation-report.md.

### Example 2: Python project without config generator

```bash
/nw:mutation-test auth-upgrade tests/auth/
```

Orchestrator extracts files manually from execution-log.yaml, creates a single cosmic-ray config with `module-path = [file1, file2, ...]` and `test-command = "pytest -x tests/auth/"`, delegates to agent.

### Example 3: Non-Python project

```bash
/nw:mutation-test payment-gateway tests/payment/
```

Orchestrator detects `package.json`, selects Stryker, delegates with Stryker-specific instructions.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Implementation files extracted from execution-log.yaml
- [ ] All implementation files verified on disk
- [ ] Mutation testing executed without errors
- [ ] Per-file breakdown in mutation-report.md
- [ ] Kill rate meets threshold (>= 80% PASS, 70-80% WARN, < 70% FAIL)

## Quality Gate

| Score | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| >= 80% | PASS | Proceed to finalize |
| 70-80% | WARN | Review surviving mutants, may proceed with justification |
| < 70% | FAIL | Add tests before proceeding |

## Skip Conditions

- Language has no mutation tool available
- Project opts out via `.mutation-config.yaml` with documented justification
- Test suite is empty or broken (fix first)

Python projects require mutation testing; all skips need documented justification.

## Next Wave

**Handoff To**: Phase 8 - Finalize (orchestrator continues develop.md workflow)
**Deliverables**: `docs/feature/{project-id}/mutation/mutation-report.md`

# Expected outputs:
# - docs/feature/{project-id}/mutation/mutation-report.md
# - docs/feature/{project-id}/mutation/cosmic-ray-*.toml (ephemeral)
