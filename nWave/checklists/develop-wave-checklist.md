# DEVELOP Wave Quality Checklist

## Overview

Validation checklist for DEVELOP wave completion focusing on Outside-In TDD with double-loop architecture, systematic refactoring, and production service integration with progressive complexity levels.

---

## 🟢 **BASIC Level - Essential DEVELOP Wave Requirements**

### Outside-In TDD Foundation

- [ ] **Double-loop TDD architecture implemented**
  - Outer loop (E2E/Acceptance tests) driving development
  - Inner loop (Unit tests) implementing business logic
  - Clear progression from failing acceptance test to passing implementation

- [ ] **One E2E test at a time strategy followed**
  - Single E2E test enabled during development cycle
  - Other E2E tests marked with [Ignore] attribute
  - Complete implementation before enabling next E2E test

### Production Service Integration

- [ ] **Step methods call production services**
  - All step methods use \_serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<T>() pattern
