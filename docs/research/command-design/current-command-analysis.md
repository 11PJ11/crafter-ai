## 4. Pattern Identification

### 4.1 Common Boilerplate (Repeated Across Files)

**Orchestrator Briefing Block** -- Appears in 12 commands (verbatim or near-verbatim):
```
**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRAINT**: Sub-agents launched via Task tool
have NO ACCESS to the Skill tool. They can ONLY use: Read, Write, Edit,
Bash, Glob, Grep.
```
~20-30 lines each occurrence. **Total waste: ~300 lines across all files.**

**Agent Registry Block** -- Appears in 6 commands (execute, finalize, roadmap, review, develop, document):
```
Valid agents are: nw-researcher, nw-software-crafter, nw-solution-architect...
Each agent has specific capabilities:
- nw-researcher: Information gathering...
```
~15-20 lines each. **Total waste: ~100 lines.**

**Parameter Parsing Rules** -- Appears in 5 commands (execute, finalize, roadmap, review, develop):
```
Apply these rules to ALL extracted parameters:
1. Strip leading and trailing whitespace
2. Remove surrounding quotes...
```
~10-15 lines each. **Total waste: ~60 lines.**

**"What NOT to Include" block** -- Appears in 11 commands:
```
- "Agent should invoke /nw:X" (agent cannot invoke them)
- Any reference to skills or other commands
```
~8-12 lines each. **Total waste: ~100 lines.**

**Pre-Invocation Validation Checklist** -- Appears in 5 commands:
```
Before invoking Task tool, verify ALL items:
- [ ] Agent name extracted and validated
- [ ] Agent name in valid agent list...
```
~10-15 lines each. **Total waste: ~60 lines.**

### 4.2 Sections Duplicating Agent Knowledge

| Command | Duplicated Knowledge | Lines | Should Live In |
|---------|---------------------|-------|---------------|
| document.md | DIVIO templates (tutorial/howto/reference/explanation) | ~150 | nw-documentarist agent |
| document.md | Research procedures & quality gates | ~80 | nw-researcher agent |
| distill.md | BDD/Gherkin syntax, hexagonal boundary enforcement (CM-A) | ~120 | nw-acceptance-designer agent |
| design.md | Hexagonal architecture principles, reuse checklist | ~60 | nw-solution-architect agent |
| mutation-test.md | Cosmic-ray configuration, multi-language tool matrix | ~200 | nw-software-crafter agent/skill |
| finalize.md | Evolution document template, archive procedures | ~150 | nw-devop agent |
| execute.md | TDD 7-phase cycle details, checkpoint strategy | ~200 | nw-software-crafter agent |
| roadmap.md | Roadmap YAML schema, step decomposition rules | ~150 | nw-solution-architect agent |
| journey.md | UX discovery questions, emotional arc design | ~200 | nw-leanux-designer agent |

**Estimated total agent-knowledge duplication: ~1,300 lines (13% of all command content).**

### 4.3 Sections Duplicating Platform Capabilities

| Pattern | Occurrences | Lines Each | Platform Feature |
|---------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| "Sub-agents have NO ACCESS to Skill tool" | 12 | 3-5 | Architecture fact, state once |
| Agent registry validation | 6 | 15-20 | Could be a shared lookup |
| Parameter parsing rules | 5 | 10-15 | Could be standardized utility |
| Pre-invocation checklist | 5 | 10-15 | Could be shared pattern |

### 4.4 Parameter Parsing Patterns

**Inconsistent across commands:**
- execute.md: 3 params (agent, project-id, step-id) -- unique
- finalize.md: 2 params (agent, project-id) -- shared with roadmap
- roadmap.md: 2 params (agent, goal-description) -- similar to finalize
- review.md: 3 params (agent, artifact-type, artifact-path) -- unique
- All others: 0-1 params (topic name only)

Each command re-implements the same parsing logic. No shared pattern.

### 4.5 Delegation Patterns

**Three distinct patterns:**

1. **Dispatcher pattern** (15 commands): Command describes agent invocation, orchestrator delegates via Task tool. Includes orchestrator briefing, "What to do/not do" blocks.

2. **Orchestrator pattern** (1 command: develop.md): Command IS the orchestrator. Reads other commands, extracts workflows, builds prompts. Most complex.

3. **Documentation pattern** (5 commands: version, update, start, git, forge): Minimal delegation, mostly reference docs.

## 5. Anti-Pattern Inventory

### 5.1 Commands Containing Domain Knowledge Belonging in Agents

| Command | Domain Knowledge | Lines | Impact |
|---------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| mutation-test.md | Complete cosmic-ray config format, multi-language tool matrix, venv setup, feature-scoped config generation | ~300 | Agent should know mutation tools |
| document.md | Complete DIVIO framework with 4 templates + review criteria | ~400 | Documentarist/researcher agents own this |
| distill.md | BDD syntax, hexagonal boundary rules, test directory conventions | ~250 | Acceptance-designer agent owns this |
| journey.md | UX discovery methodology, emotional arc patterns, artifact tracking | ~250 | Luna agent owns this |
| execute.md | TDD 7-phase details, checkpoint commit strategy, state machine | ~250 | Software-crafter agent owns this |

### 5.2 Commands Re-implementing Agent Workflows

- **develop.md** re-implements the entire workflow of 6+ other commands inline (roadmap, execute, review, mutation-test, refactor, finalize). It embeds ~600 lines of mutation-test workflow and ~400 lines of refactoring workflow.
- **document.md** re-implements the full 4-phase research-review-document-review workflow that could be a simple "invoke these agents in sequence."

### 5.3 Overly Prescriptive Step-by-Step Instructions

- **execute.md** STEP 1-5: 250 lines of parameter extraction that amounts to "parse arguments and invoke Task tool"
- **finalize.md** STEP 1-5: 200 lines of identical parameter parsing
- **roadmap.md** STEP 1-5: 200 lines of identical parameter parsing
- **review.md** STEP 1-5: 200 lines of identical parameter parsing

**These 4 commands share ~90% identical parameter parsing logic across ~800 lines.**

### 5.4 Redundant Validation

- **finalize.md** Step 4.5 (all-steps-complete gate): 40 lines of validation that the devop agent should perform
- **distill.md** CM-A hexagonal boundary check: 50 lines duplicated in finalize.md as CM-E
- **review.md** format validation for execution-log.yaml: 40 lines the reviewer agent already enforces
- **execute.md** pre-invocation checklist: 15 items, most of which are trivial (non-empty strings)

### 5.5 Dead Code / Unused Sections

| Command | Dead Content | Lines |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| execute.md | JSON state examples (contradicts v2.0 pipe format) | ~200 |
| execute.md | Execution queue management JSON (never implemented) | ~15 |
| execute.md | Deprecated step file references ("OLD SIGNATURE") | ~20 |
| roadmap.md | `<!-- BUILD:INJECT -->` placeholder (never built) | ~5 |
| roadmap.md | Baseline file validation gate (commented out in v2.0) | ~10 |
| finalize.md | Step JSON file references ("Legacy step files") | ~10 |
| review.md | Old split command references | ~10 |
| develop.md | Schema v1.0 references mixed with v2.0 | ~50 |
| version.md | Hardcoded version "1.6.46" (will be stale) | all |

---

## 6. Comparison with Agent Migration

### Same "Production Frameworks" Bloat?

**Yes, worse.** Commands have the same monolithic tendency as agents, but amplified by:
- Commands duplicate agent knowledge AND add orchestration boilerplate on top
- The "Orchestrator Briefing" pattern adds 20-30 lines to every file
- Commands contain complete agent prompt templates (sometimes 100+ lines of prompt text that the orchestrator must copy verbatim)

### Same Aggressive Language?

**Pervasive.** Examples from commands:

| Aggressive Pattern | Count | Files |
|-------------------|-------|-------|
| "CRITICAL" | 45+ | Nearly all |
| "MANDATORY" | 20+ | execute, finalize, roadmap, review, mutation-test, develop |
| "BLOCKING" / "HARD BLOCKER" | 8 | execute, finalize, roadmap, develop |
| "NON-NEGOTIABLE" | 2 | finalize, execute |
| Emoji emphasis (warning signs, checkmarks) | 50+ | develop, mutation-test, distill |

The develop.md file alone contains the word "CRITICAL" 15+ times.

### Same Monolithic vs Modular Tension?

**Identical pattern.** The top 4 commands (develop, document, execute, finalize) exhibit the same monolithic bloat as the worst agents:

| Metric | Agents (pre-migration) | Commands |
|--------|----------------------|----------|
| Largest file | ~2,000 lines | 2,394 lines (develop.md) |
| Top 4 files % of total | ~55% | 56% |
| Boilerplate repetition | Safety frameworks | Orchestrator briefings |
| Domain knowledge location | Embedded in agents | Duplicated in commands AND agents |
| Aggressive language | Moderate | Heavy |

---

## 7. Key Findings

### The 80/20 Problem

- **80% of command content** lives in 6 files (develop, document, execute, finalize, roadmap, review)
- **~30% of that content** is removable (duplicated knowledge, deprecated formats, verbose examples)
- **~15% of all content** is boilerplate repeated across files

### The Duplication Triangle

Commands duplicate content in three directions:
1. **Command-to-Command**: Orchestrator briefings, agent registries, parameter parsing (5-6x each)
2. **Command-to-Agent**: Domain knowledge that belongs in agents (~1,300 lines)
3. **Command-to-Self**: develop.md embeds other commands inline (~1,000 lines)

### Estimated Reducible Content

| Category | Lines | % of Total |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Cross-command boilerplate | ~620 | 6% |
| Agent knowledge duplication | ~1,300 | 13% |
| Dead code / deprecated refs | ~320 | 3% |
| Verbose examples (JSON state) | ~400 | 4% |
| develop.md inline command duplication | ~1,000 | 10% |
| **Total reducible** | **~3,640** | **36%** |

A well-structured command system could deliver the same functionality in ~6,400 lines (vs current 10,067).

### The Forge Model

`forge.md` at 40 lines is the ideal. It:
- Names the agent
- States what to do
- Lists success criteria
- References agent for all domain knowledge

Every dispatcher command could follow this pattern at 40-100 lines if domain knowledge lives in agents and boilerplate is extracted to a shared preamble.

---

## 8. Recommendations (Summary)

1. **Extract shared boilerplate** into a single preamble file (orchestrator briefing, agent registry, parameter parsing rules, pre-invocation checklist). Commands reference it, not copy it.

2. **Move domain knowledge back to agents**. Commands should be thin dispatchers (forge.md model). Agent prompt templates belong in agents, not commands.

3. **Decompose develop.md** from 2,394-line monolith into a lean orchestrator that references sub-commands rather than embedding them.

4. **Purge dead code**: Remove all JSON state examples, deprecated step file references, v1.0 schema notes, BUILD:INJECT placeholders.

5. **Standardize command structure** around the forge.md pattern: header, overview, agent invocation, success criteria, next wave. Target 40-150 lines per command.

6. **Remove aggressive language**: Replace "CRITICAL", "MANDATORY", "NON-NEGOTIABLE", "HARD BLOCKER" with direct statements.
