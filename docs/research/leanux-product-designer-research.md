# LeanUX++ Product Designer Agent: Comprehensive Research

**Date**: 2026-01-30
**Researcher**: Nova (Evidence-Driven Knowledge Researcher)
**Overall Confidence**: High
**Sources Consulted**: 75+

## Executive Summary

This research validates the hypothesis that a LeanUX Designer agent, paired with the Product Owner in the DISCUSS phase, would prevent feature integration failures by introducing user personas, journey mapping, and progressive-fidelity prototypes before development begins.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Hypothesis Validated with Enhancement**: The core hypothesis is strongly supported by evidence. However, the solution should go beyond "adding a UX agent" to implementing **structured UX checkpoints at specific handover gates**. The problem of "vertically excellent, horizontally broken" features is a well-documented failure mode that modern UX methodologies specifically address.

2. **Post-Lean UX Evolution**: Lean UX (2013) has not been replaced but **extended and integrated** with complementary methodologies: Design Sprints, Continuous Discovery Habits, Dual-Track Agile, Shape Up, and Jobs-to-be-Done. The current state-of-the-art is **Continuous Discovery** paired with **Dual-Track Development**.

3. **Apple and Google Convergence**: Both companies have evolved toward more expressive, human-centered design languages (Apple's Liquid Glass in 2025, Google's Material 3 Expressive in 2025). The underlying principle is identical: **form follows feeling**, with research-backed emotional design.

4. **CLI/TUI UX Exists**: A substantial body of knowledge exists for command-line interface design, documented in the [Command Line Interface Guidelines](https://clig.dev/) and practiced by successful tools (gh, docker, npm, cargo).

5. **The Core Problem Solution**: Horizontal feature coherence requires **user journey mapping as a first-class artifact** that persists across sprints and serves as the integration checkpoint. This is exactly what's missing in most vertical feature-focused workflows.

## Part 1: Post-Lean UX Evolution (2013-2025)

### 1.1 The Lean UX Foundation (2013)

Lean UX was published in 2013 by [Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden](https://leanuxbook.com/). The core argument: **UX should be measured by user outcomes, not polished interfaces**. The methodology blends Lean Startup, Design Thinking, and Agile principles.

**Key Lean UX Principles:**
- Think-Make-Check cycles (rapid iteration)
- Minimum Viable Products for learning
- Hypothesis-driven design
- Cross-functional collaboration
- Outcomes over deliverables

**Third Edition Updates (2021)**: The book was reorganized around the **Lean UX Canvas**, a one-page framework for aligning teams around assumptions, hypotheses, and experiments. Enhanced Agile/Scrum integration was added based on collaboration with scrum.org.

### 1.2 What Complemented Lean UX

Rather than being "replaced," Lean UX has been **complemented and extended** by other methodologies:

#### Design Sprints (2016)

[Jake Knapp's Design Sprint](https://www.thesprintbook.com/) from Google Ventures solved Lean UX's weakness: **inefficiency when a product plan wasn't well defined**. The 5-day sprint format (Map, Sketch, Decide, Prototype, Test) eliminated waste and rework.

**Key Innovation**: Time-boxing intensive design work to 5 days with cross-functional teams, culminating in user testing with real prototypes.

**When to Use**: Early-stage products, new features with high uncertainty, breaking through analysis paralysis.

**When NOT to Use**: When a validated product design already exists, for minor iterations, or when lacking decision-maker commitment.

#### Continuous Discovery Habits (2021)

[Teresa Torres's book](https://www.producttalk.org/2021/05/continuous-discovery-habits/) represents the current state-of-the-art for shift-left UX validation.

**Keystone Habit**: Talking with customers weekly.

**Core Framework**: The **Opportunity Solution Tree** - a visual representation connecting business outcomes to customer opportunities to potential solutions to assumption tests.

**Key Principles**:
- Start with a clear outcome
- Interview to discover opportunities
- Assumption test to evaluate solutions
- Work on one small opportunity at a time

#### Dual-Track Agile (2012)

[Jeff Patton and Marty Cagan](https://www.svpg.com/dual-track-agile/) introduced Dual-Track Scrum/Agile around 2012. It captures the **parallel nature of Discovery and Delivery**.

**Discovery Track**: Quickly generating validated product backlog items
**Delivery Track**: Generating releasable software

**Key Insight**: The product manager, designer, and lead engineer work together side-by-side to create and validate backlog items, not in sequential handoffs.

**Common Myths Debunked**:
- Discovery is NOT a process that precedes agile development
- The discovery team should NOT be different from the development team

#### Shape Up (2019)

[Basecamp's Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) by Ryan Singer offers an alternative to Scrum with **6-week cycles and fixed time, variable scope**.

**Key Differentiators**:
- No product backlog
- Fixed time, variable scope (opposite of Scrum)
- "Shaping" done by senior members before handoff
- No daily standups
- Hill Charts for progress tracking

**Trade-off**: Works best for small-to-medium teams; scaling guidance is limited.

#### Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

[Originally conceptualized by Tony Ulwick in 1990](https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/), popularized by [Clayton Christensen in 2003](https://www.christenseninstitute.org/theory/jobs-to-be-done/), and refined through multiple practitioners.

**Core Concept**: People don't buy products; they "hire" them to do specific jobs. A "job" is the progress a person wants to make in specific circumstances.

**Three JTBD Interpretations**:
1. **Christensen's Theory**: Focuses on understanding the job, circumstances, and progress
2. **Bob Moesta's Demand-Side Sales**: Applies JTBD to understanding buying behavior
3. **Tony Ulwick's Outcome-Driven Innovation**: Uses desired outcome statements to predict innovation success (86% success rate claimed)

**The Milkshake Example**: McDonald's discovered morning milkshake buyers weren't competing against other milkshakes - they were competing against bananas and bagels for the job of "make my commute less boring."

### 1.3 The Double Diamond (2019 Update)

The [British Design Council updated the Double Diamond](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/our-resources/the-double-diamond/) in 2019, addressing its linear (waterfall) criticism by adding iterative features.

**Four Phases**:
1. **Discover**: Understand the issue (divergent thinking)
2. **Define**: Synthesize and define the problem (convergent thinking)
3. **Develop**: Generate multiple solutions (divergent thinking)
4. **Deliver**: Test and refine solutions (convergent thinking)

**2019 Enhancement**: Added iteration arrows showing the process is not linear - learning can send teams back to earlier phases.

### 1.4 Methodology Comparison Matrix

| Methodology | Best For | Time Frame | Team Size | Key Artifact |
|-------------|----------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| Lean UX | Continuous iteration on existing products | Ongoing sprints | 5-9 | Lean UX Canvas |
| Design Sprint | Solving big problems, validating ideas | 5 days | 4-7 | Tested Prototype |
| Continuous Discovery | Building habits of customer-centricity | Ongoing (weekly) | Product trio | Opportunity Solution Tree |
| Dual-Track Agile | Parallel discovery and delivery | Sprint-based | Full squad | Validated Backlog Items |
| Shape Up | Focused delivery without backlog debt | 6-week cycles | Small teams | Shaped Pitch |
| JTBD | Understanding customer motivation | Research phase | Research team | Job Map |
| Double Diamond | End-to-end design process | Project-based | Variable | Service Blueprint |

## Part 2: Apple Design Philosophy and Practices

### 2.1 Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)

[Apple's Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/) represent the official documentation of Apple's design philosophy.

**Core Principles**:
- **Clarity**: Interfaces should be clean, precise, and uncluttered
- **Deference**: Content takes precedence over chrome
- **Depth**: Visual layers and motion provide context and meaning

**Practical Guidelines**:
- Touch targets: Minimum 44x44 points (research shows 25%+ of users miss smaller targets)
- Typography: San Francisco font, 17pt default text
- Hierarchy: Organize visual elements to prioritize important information

### 2.2 The Liquid Glass Era (2025)

In June 2025, Apple introduced **Liquid Glass**, its most significant visual redesign since iOS 7 in 2013.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Translucent UI elements with glass-like optical qualities (including refraction)
- Dynamic adaptation to light and content
- Unified aesthetic across iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26

**Design System Principle**: "A harmonized design language that's more cohesive, adaptive and expressive" - reshaping the relationship between interface and content.

### 2.3 Apple's Internal Design Process

**The Apple New Product Process (ANPP)**: Detailed documentation given to product development teams defining every stage, responsibilities, timelines, and expectations.

**Key Characteristics**:
1. **Integration of Design and Engineering**: Hardware, software, materials, and experience are shaped together from the start. The iPhone and iOS feel like one unit because they were developed in tandem.

2. **Iterative Prototyping**: Dozens of models before final selection. As [Jony Ive described](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/apple-s-product-development-process-inside-the-world-s-greatest-design-organization): "The most remarkable point in the whole process is when you make the first model."

3. **Monday Review Meetings**: The Executive Team examines every product in design phase weekly.

4. **Concentrated Resources**: Apple doesn't work on hundreds of products at once - resources are concentrated on a handful of high-potential projects.

5. **Hidden Detail Obsession**: When the Mac design was finalized, engineers signed their names inside the case - where no user would ever see them, but the team knew they were there.

### 2.4 The Jobs-Ive Partnership

From [Ken Kocienda's "Creative Selection"](https://www.creativeselection.io/) and [Walter Isaacson's biography](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Steve-Jobs/Walter-Isaacson/9781982176860):

**Jobs on Design**: "Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers."

**The Collaboration Model**: Jobs and Ive would sit with prototypes. If anything felt off, it went back - even the smallest things were worth redoing.

**Creative Selection Process**: Demo/dogfood/iterate/converge with tight loops of communication and minimal teams (enforced by secrecy).

### 2.5 Apple Design Principles Synthesis

| Principle | Description | Application to LeanUX Agent |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **End-to-End Integration** | Hardware, software, and experience designed together | User journey spans all features, not just individual slices |
| **Simplicity as Sophistication** | Remove unnecessary complexity | Focus on essential user needs, not feature accumulation |
| **Material Honesty** | Design reflects the product's essence | CLI should feel like CLI, not a poor GUI imitation |
| **Iterative Perfection** | Many prototypes before final selection | Multiple fidelity levels before committing to implementation |
| **Hidden Quality** | Excellence even in unseen details | Technical architecture should be as elegant as user-facing design |
| **Concentrated Focus** | Few projects done excellently | One user journey perfected before expanding scope |

## Part 3: Google Design Philosophy and Practices

### 3.1 Material Design Evolution

**Material Design 1.0 (2014)**: Introduced the concept of "material" - UI elements behaving like physical objects with weight, dimension, and response to touch.

**Material Design 2.0 (Material Theming)**: Added flexibility and customization while maintaining consistency.

**Material Design 3 (Material You, 2021)**: Dynamic Color system adapting to user preferences and content.

**Material 3 Expressive (2025)**: [Announced at Google I/O 2025](https://m3.material.io/) as "one of our biggest updates in years."

### 3.2 Material 3 Expressive Principles

**Research Foundation**: 46 separate research studies, 18,000+ participants worldwide, validating that the system is both beautiful and highly usable.

**Core Innovation**: "Form follows feeling" - shape, color, and motion create engaging, personalized experiences.

**Eye-Tracking Result**: Participants spotted key UI elements up to 4x faster in M3 Expressive designs.

**Core Design Elements**:
- **Color**: Expressive, personalized, accessible
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy, adaptable to context
- **Shape**: Communicates meaning and interaction affordances
- **Motion**: Provides feedback and continuity
- **Interaction**: Responsive, accessible, intuitive
- **Layout**: Adaptive to screen size and context
- **Elevation**: Creates hierarchy through depth

### 3.3 Google Design Sprint Methodology

[Jake Knapp created the Design Sprint at Google in 2010](https://www.gv.com/sprint/), refined it through 2012 at Google X, Chrome, and Search, then perfected it at Google Ventures.

**The 5-Day Process**:

| Day | Activity | Outcome |
|-----|----------|---------|
| Monday | Map the problem | Long-term goal, challenge map, target selection |
| Tuesday | Sketch solutions | Individual solution sketches |
| Wednesday | Decide on approach | Storyboard of winning solution |
| Thursday | Build prototype | Realistic facade for testing |
| Friday | Test with users | Validated learning |

**Team Composition**: 4-7 people including facilitator, designer, decision-maker, product manager, engineer, and business representative.

**Critical Success Factor**: Having a decision-maker (often CEO for startups) present and committed.

### 3.4 HEART Framework for UX Metrics

[Developed by Kerry Rodden, Hilary Hutchinson, and Xin Fu at Google in 2010](https://www.heartframework.com/):

| Metric | Definition | Example Signal | Example Metric |
|--------|------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Happiness** | User satisfaction and attitude | Survey responses | NPS score, satisfaction rating |
| **Engagement** | Depth and frequency of use | Session activity | Sessions per user per week |
| **Adoption** | New users acquiring the product | New signups | New users in time period |
| **Retention** | Existing users returning | Return visits | % users active after 7 days |
| **Task Success** | Ability to complete tasks | Task completion | Error rate, time on task |

**Goals-Signals-Metrics Process**: Set objectives (Goals), find indicators (Signals), quantify (Metrics).

### 3.5 Google Design Principles Synthesis

| Principle | Description | Application to LeanUX Agent |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **Research-Backed Design** | 18,000+ participants validate decisions | User research at every phase, not just discovery |
| **Systematic Personalization** | Dynamic color, adaptive components | Respect user preferences and context |
| **Accessibility as Foundation** | WCAG compliance built-in | CLI accessibility from the start |
| **Form Follows Feeling** | Emotional design priority | Consider user emotions in every interaction |
| **Component-Based Design** | Reusable, consistent elements | Design system thinking for CLI commands |

## Part 4: User-Centric Design Fundamentals

### 4.1 Modern Persona Creation

**Research-Based Personas**: The biggest mistake is guessing. Personas must represent real patterns discovered through research, not ideal users you wish you had.

**Three Approaches by Resource Level**:

1. **Proto Personas** (Low resource): Created in workshops from existing knowledge, useful when you have no personas yet. Can be created in hours.

2. **Qualitative Personas** (Medium resource): Based on 5-30 interviews. Balanced approach providing real user feedback on needs, challenges, and priorities.

3. **Statistical Personas** (High resource): 100-500+ survey participants, using cluster analysis to find patterns. Most rigorous but resource-intensive.

**Modern Best Practices**:
- Avoid starting with demographics (risk of stereotyping)
- Focus on goals, pain points, and interaction preferences
- Treat personas as living documents (regular updates)
- Use AI to assist creation but validate with qualitative research
- Collaborate across teams (not just designers)

**Anti-Pattern**: Creating "idealized customers" rather than realistic users.

### 4.2 User Journey Mapping

**Definition**: A visualization of the process a person goes through to accomplish a goal with your product.

**Essential Components**:
- **Actor**: The persona experiencing the journey
- **Scenario**: The specific goal or task
- **Stages**: Major phases of the experience
- **Actions**: What the user does at each stage
- **Thoughts**: What the user is thinking
- **Emotions**: The emotional journey (ups and downs)
- **Touchpoints**: Where user interacts with product/organization
- **Pain Points**: Friction, frustration, barriers
- **Opportunities**: Improvement possibilities

**2024/2025 Evolution**:
- Journey maps now connect to real-time data and orchestration systems
- AI-powered insights uncover drivers of satisfaction
- Event-based triggers can respond to journey friction automatically
- Personalization by segment is expected (71% of customers want customized interactions)

**Key Statistic**: 80% of consumers say experience is as important as products/services (Salesforce 2024).

### 4.3 Prototyping Fidelity Ladder

**Low-Fidelity (Paper/Sketches)**:
- **When**: Early ideation, brainstorming, first concepts
- **Benefits**: Fast, cheap, easy to discard, encourages exploration
- **Tools**: Paper, whiteboard, sticky notes

**Low-Fidelity (Digital Wireframes)**:
- **When**: Testing basic layout and flow
- **Benefits**: Faster iteration than visual design, focus on structure
- **Tools**: Balsamiq, Figma wireframes, simple digital tools

**Mid-Fidelity**:
- **When**: Clarifying user flow and structure without committing to visual design
- **Benefits**: More detail than wireframes, less investment than high-fi
- **Tools**: Figma, Sketch with placeholder content

**High-Fidelity Prototypes**:
- **When**: Final design validation, usability testing, developer handoff
- **Benefits**: Realistic user testing, clear implementation specification
- **Tools**: Figma, Adobe XD, InVision, Framer

**Guidance on Progression**: Move through fidelity levels organically. Ask: "Do I want to show this to others for feedback, or improve it first?" If ready to share, test at current fidelity. If want to improve, either iterate at current level or bump up fidelity.

### 4.4 Shifting UX Left

**The Cost Argument**: A defect removed after production costs ~100x more than one identified during requirements. 75% less expensive and 3x faster to fix during development than in QA or production.

**Key Shift-Left Activities**:
- Customer Journey Mapping during discovery
- Jobs-to-be-Done interviews before solutioning
- Alignment workshops with all stakeholders
- UX involvement in sprint planning
- Usability testing of prototypes before development

**AI-Assisted Shift-Left**: AI tools now enable faster wireframing, rapid prototype iteration, and quicker feedback gathering - shifting UX capacity toward earlier strategic activities.

## Part 5: Feature Integration and Horizontal Coherence

### 5.1 The Feature Silo Problem

**The Statistics**:
- 83% of executives admit silos exist in their companies
- 41% of employees find it challenging to collaborate across departments
- Cross-functional teams generate 20% more innovative solutions
- Collaborative approaches reduce critical defects by 30%

**Root Cause**: Systemic misalignment. Each team optimizes locally, but the organization suffers globally. This is a feedback loop problem.

### 5.2 Techniques for Horizontal Coherence

**1. Shared OKRs**:
- Align all teams to the same planning rhythm
- Co-create plans in joint sessions
- Use shared KPIs instead of departmental metrics

**2. Cross-Functional Team Structure**:
Apple organizes with interdisciplinary teams - designers, engineers, and marketers work together from concept to launch, not in silos.

**3. Spotify Squad Model** (with caveats):
- Squads: 8-person cross-functional teams with end-to-end responsibility
- Tribes: Collections of related squads (40-100 people)
- Chapters: Functional expertise groups (design, engineering)
- Guilds: Cross-cutting communities of practice

**Warning**: Spotify [no longer uses this model exactly as documented](https://www.jeremiahlee.com/posts/failed-squad-goals/). The model gave too much autonomy without sufficient alignment mechanisms.

**4. Product-Led Teams**:
Teams organized around outcomes (what users need) rather than outputs (features to build). Empowered to find the best solution, accountable for results.

**5. Standardized Processes and Language**:
Create a floor of product knowledge across Product and Product-Adjacent roles. Everyone uses the same documentation, terminology, and processes.

### 5.3 User Journey as Integration Artifact

**Proposed Solution for nWave Framework**:

The user journey map should be:
1. **Created in DISCUSS phase** by Product Owner + LeanUX Agent
2. **Validated before DESIGN phase** begins
3. **Referenced in every DEVELOP sprint** to ensure features connect
4. **Updated as features complete** to reflect reality
5. **Used as acceptance criteria** for horizontal integration testing

**Integration Checkpoints**:
- Does this feature connect to the next step in the user journey?
- Are there version mismatches in shared artifacts (files, configs)?
- Can a user complete their full goal, not just this feature's task?
- Is the command vocabulary consistent across related commands?

---

## Part 6: CLI/TUI User Experience

### 6.1 The Command Line Interface Guidelines

[clig.dev](https://clig.dev/) is the authoritative open-source guide for CLI design, updating traditional UNIX principles for the modern day.

**Core Philosophy**:
- Follow patterns that already exist (predictability > novelty)
- Consistency makes CLIs intuitive and users efficient
- Sometimes consistency conflicts with ease of use (resolve thoughtfully)

### 6.2 Essential CLI UX Principles

**1. Help and Documentation**:
- Always implement `--help` on main command and all subcommands
- Provide short (`-h`) and long (`--help`) forms
- Make help guessable

**2. Sensible Defaults**:
- Make the default the right thing for most users
- Don't require users to find and remember flags
- If user doesn't pass an argument, prompt (but never require prompt - allow flags for automation)

**3. Use Flags for Clarity**:
- Label arguments with flags rather than relying on position
- Users don't need to memorize argument order
- Labels provide context to each value

**4. Feedback and Progress**:
- Print something in <100ms (responsive > fast)
- Show progress for long operations
- A good spinner makes programs appear faster

**5. Error Handling**:
- Make error messages descriptive and informative
- Use exit codes correctly (0 for success, non-zero for failure)
- Suggest fixes when possible

**6. Transparency and Safety**:
- Every action should be transparent
- Implicit steps are dangerous
- Confirm before destructive actions (`-f` or `--force` to skip)

**7. Progressive Discovery**:
- Guide users to solutions in iterative steps
- Plain-language help along the way
- Interactive modes for first-time users
- Users resorting to StackOverflow is an anti-pattern

**8. Consistent Naming**:
- Have a clear philosophy for subcommands vs options, verbs vs nouns
- Don't have ambiguous names ("update" vs "upgrade" is confusing)
- Stick to patterns like `tool [noun] [verb]` or `tool [verb] [noun]`

### 6.3 CLI Design Patterns from Successful Tools

**kubectl Pattern**:
- Same command hierarchy for all resource types
- Consistent flags across objects (`--output="jsonpath={.status}"` works everywhere)
- Consistent with Kubernetes concepts

**gh (GitHub CLI) Pattern**:
- `gh [entity] [action]` structure
- Progressive disclosure (basic commands first, advanced via flags)
- Integration with Git workflows

**docker Pattern**:
- Two-level subcommands: `docker container create`
- Consistent verbs across different object types
- Strong help documentation

### 6.4 TUI Development Ecosystem

**Libraries by Language**:
- **Go**: Bubbletea (Charm)
- **Python**: Rich, Textual (modern, async), pytermgui
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Ink (React-based), OpenTUI
- **.NET**: Spectre.Console, Terminal.Gui
- **Rust**: Ratatui, crossterm

**Prototyping Approach**: Since no dedicated TUI wireframing tools exist, prototype by:
1. Sketching screen layouts in text/ASCII
2. Building low-fidelity implementations quickly
3. Testing with actual terminal users
4. Iterating on real feedback

### 6.5 CLI UX Synthesis for nWave

| Principle | Application to crafter-ai CLI |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Consistent Command Structure** | `crafter [phase] [action]` or similar |
| **Progressive Disclosure** | Basic commands obvious, advanced discoverable |
| **Contextual Help** | Inline suggestions, error recovery guidance |
| **Transparent Operations** | Show what agents are doing, don't hide complexity |
| **Predictable Patterns** | Same flags work the same way across commands |
| **Graceful Degradation** | Clear feedback when things fail, recovery paths |

## Part 7: Adversarial Challenge - When UX Design Fails

### 7.1 Valid Critiques of Lean UX

**UX Debt Accumulation**: In the rush to add features, UI can be stripped back so far it compromises usability. Speed can create debt.

**Integration Challenges with Agile**: Finding time for user research in rapid sprints creates tension. Advocacy required.

**Wicked Problem**: Implementing Lean UX correctly requires implementing it wrong first and earning political capital to fix it over time.

**"Quick and Dirty" Research Limitations**: Results need to be delivered before next sprint - less focus on rigorous, documented outputs.

**Not Suitable for High-Stakes**: "You can't 'move fast and break things' when the product has life or death implications."

### 7.2 Design Sprint Failure Modes

**Wrong Team Composition**: Filling sprints with only designers when they need decision-makers, engineers, and business representation.

**Wrong Problem Scope**: Some problems are beyond a 5-day sprint; others are too narrow. The sprint is not a silver bullet.

**Lack of Adoption**: Design sprints never achieved the adoption of Agile sprints. They're often misused or misunderstood.

**Redundancy for Experienced Designers**: Activities like user interviews, ideation, prototyping are daily routine for designers - structured sprints can feel like a waste of time.

**Poor Facilitation**: Facilitators who participate instead of facilitate, who get attached to ideas, or who allow pacing problems.

### 7.3 When Vertical Focus Is Superior

**High-Confidence Solutions**: When you know the solution will work, outcome-based approaches are less useful. Output planning is appropriate for operations.

**Execution Over Discovery**: When a validated design exists and the team just needs to execute, design sprints add overhead.

**Technical Debt Payoff**: Sometimes horizontal integration must wait while critical technical foundations are built.

**Resource Constraints**: A small team may need to ship vertically to prove value before earning resources for horizontal integration.

### 7.4 Over-Design Failure Modes

**Analysis Paralysis**: Endless research and validation without shipping anything.

**Premature Optimization**: Designing for scale and edge cases before proving core value.

**Design by Committee**: Too much stakeholder input diluting clear product vision.

**Persona Fiction**: Personas based on imagination rather than research, leading design astray.

**Journey Map Theater**: Beautiful journey maps that get framed and forgotten rather than used.

### 7.5 Risk Mitigation for LeanUX Agent

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| UX ceremony adds overhead | Time-box all UX activities; validate ROI |
| Journey maps become shelfware | Make journey map a living document updated each sprint |
| Personas are fictional | Base on real user interviews, update regularly |
| Horizontal coherence blocks shipping | Ship vertical slices, track integration debt explicitly |
| Design becomes bottleneck | Empower developers to make minor UX decisions within guidelines |

## Part 8: Application to Agent Design

### 8.1 Recommended LeanUX Agent Responsibilities

**DISCUSS Phase (Primary)**:
1. **User Journey Mapping**: Create and maintain the journey map as primary artifact
2. **Persona Validation**: Ensure user stories reference validated personas
3. **JTBD Analysis**: Identify the "job" each feature helps users accomplish
4. **Horizontal Coherence Check**: Flag features that don't connect to the journey
5. **Prototype Planning**: Determine appropriate fidelity for validation

**DESIGN Phase (Secondary)**:
1. **Design Sprint Facilitation**: Run abbreviated design sprints for high-uncertainty features
2. **Prototype Review**: Validate prototypes against journey map
3. **CLI UX Consistency**: Check command naming, flags, help text against guidelines
4. **Integration Planning**: Identify touchpoints with existing features

**DEVELOP Phase (Checkpoint)**:
1. **Acceptance Criteria Review**: Ensure horizontal integration criteria exist
2. **User Testing Coordination**: Plan validation of completed features
3. **Journey Map Update**: Reflect reality as features complete

### 8.2 Proposed Handover Artifacts

**From LeanUX Agent to Design Phase**:
```
docs/discuss/{feature}/
  user-journey-map.md      # Full journey with this feature in context
  personas-referenced.md   # Which personas, which jobs
  coherence-assessment.md  # How this connects to other features
  prototype-plan.md        # What fidelity, what to test
  ux-acceptance-criteria.md # Horizontal integration requirements
```

**From LeanUX Agent to Develop Phase**:
```
docs/design/{feature}/
  journey-integration-checklist.md  # Specific integration points to implement
  cli-ux-guidelines.md              # Commands, flags, help text standards
```

### 8.3 Integration with nWave Flow

**DISCUSS Phase Gate**:
- [ ] User journey map created/updated
- [ ] Feature placed in journey context
- [ ] Personas validated

- [ ] CLI commands follow established patterns
- [ ] User can complete full journey (not just this feature's task)

### 8.4 Metrics for LeanUX Agent Success

Using HEART Framework adapted for CLI:

| Metric | Signal | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Happiness** | User satisfaction with workflow coherence | Post-session surveys, feedback |
| **Engagement** | Depth of feature usage | Commands used per session |
| **Adoption** | New users completing full journeys | Journey completion rate |
| **Retention** | Users returning to use integrated features | Return usage patterns |
| **Task Success** | Users completing intended goals | Error rate, completion rate, time on task |

## Part 10: Knowledge Gaps and Recommendations

### 10.1 Identified Knowledge Gaps

**Gap 1: CLI-Specific User Research Methods**
- **Issue**: Most UX research methods assume visual interfaces
- **Attempted Sources**: Academic databases, practitioner guides
- **Recommendation**: Adapt standard methods; focus on task completion, error rates, command discoverability

**Gap 2: Terminal Prototyping Tools**
- **Issue**: No dedicated TUI wireframing tools exist
- **Recommendation**: Use ASCII sketches, rapid code prototypes, or adapt general tools

**Gap 3: Multi-Agent UX Coordination**
- **Issue**: Literature on multiple AI agents collaborating on UX is nascent
- **Recommendation**: Apply service design principles; treat agents as service touchpoints

### 10.2 Recommendations for Further Research

1. **Case Studies**: Collect internal case studies as the LeanUX agent is deployed
2. **CLI UX Metrics**: Develop crafter-ai-specific metrics based on HEART framework
3. **Agent Collaboration Patterns**: Document what works/fails when agents hand off UX artifacts
4. **Journey Map Evolution**: Track how journey maps change over project lifecycle

## Part 11: Conclusion and Synthesis

### The Apple LeanUX++ Synthesis

The "perfect Apple LeanUX++ product designer" combines:

**From Apple**:
- End-to-end integration thinking (horizontal coherence)
- Obsessive attention to detail (even hidden details)
- Concentrated focus (do few things excellently)
- Creative selection (demo/dogfood/iterate/converge)

**From Lean UX**:
- Hypothesis-driven design
- Outcomes over outputs
- Cross-functional collaboration
- Minimum viable learning

**From Continuous Discovery**:
- Weekly customer conversations
- Opportunity Solution Trees for decision-making
- Assumption testing before building
- Small, iterative experiments

**From JTBD**:
- Focus on jobs, not features
- Understand circumstances, not just needs
- Compete against surprising alternatives

**From Service Design**:
- Journey mapping as primary artifact
- End-to-end experience thinking
- Touchpoint orchestration

**From CLI UX**:
- Consistency and predictability
- Progressive disclosure
- Transparent operations
- Graceful error handling

### Final Recommendation

**Implement the LeanUX Agent with these priorities**:

1. **User Journey Map as Living Document**: The primary artifact, updated every sprint, used as integration checklist

2. **Structured Checkpoints, Not Just Activities**: UX gates at each phase transition, not just "do some UX work"

3. **CLI-Specific Guidelines**: Establish command vocabulary, flag conventions, help text standards from day one

4. **Metrics from Start**: HEART-based metrics adapted for CLI, tracked from first feature

5. **Iterative Refinement**: The agent itself should evolve through use - practice continuous discovery on the agent
