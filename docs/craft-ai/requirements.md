# AI-Craft System Requirements

## Business Context

AI-Craft addresses the need for systematic, high-quality software development through intelligent automation and specialized expertise coordination. The system implements ATDD (Acceptance Test Driven Development) methodology with AI agent orchestration to ensure comprehensive quality assurance and consistent delivery standards.

### Problem Domain
- **Manual ATDD Implementation**: Complex to implement ATDD methodology manually across teams
- **Context Pollution**: Traditional approaches lead to mixed contexts and inefficient processing
- **Quality Inconsistency**: Varying quality standards and validation approaches across projects
- **Workflow Complexity**: Difficulty coordinating multiple specialized roles and handoffs
- **Project Analysis Overhead**: Time-intensive manual analysis of existing project state

### Business Value Proposition
- **Systematic Quality**: Consistent Level 1-6 progressive refactoring and validation
- **Intelligent Automation**: Automatic project analysis and optimal workflow initiation
- **Specialized Expertise**: Conditional activation of expert agents (UX, Security, Legal)
- **Rapid Deployment**: Walking skeleton and production readiness acceleration
- **Professional Standards**: Industry best practices with Toyota 5 Whys root cause analysis

## User Stories

### Epic 1: Intelligent Workflow Initiation
**As a** development team member  
**I want** to start ATDD workflows with a single command  
**So that** I can automatically analyze project context and begin at the optimal stage

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a project with existing code/documentation
- When I run `cai/atdd "feature description"`
- Then the system analyzes project context and determines optimal entry point
- And provides clear next steps and progress indicators

### Epic 2: Clean Context Agent Processing
**As a** specialized AI agent  
**I want** to receive only essential, role-specific context  
**So that** I can focus on my single responsibility without distraction

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a wave processing stage
- When an agent is invoked
- Then it receives only context relevant to its specific role
- And produces structured output files for the next stage
- And maintains no state between invocations

### Epic 3: Progressive Quality Assurance
**As a** development team  
**I want** systematic quality validation across multiple dimensions  
**So that** code meets professional standards before commit

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given completed development work
- When quality validation is triggered
- Then 8 specialized validation agents assess different quality aspects
- And Level 1-6 progressive refactoring is applied systematically
- And all validation must pass before commit approval

### Epic 4: Conditional Specialist Expertise
**As a** project requiring specialized knowledge  
**I want** expert agents activated only when needed  
**So that** I get specialized expertise without unnecessary overhead

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a project with UI/UX requirements
- When ATDD workflow is initiated
- Then User Experience Designer agent is conditionally activated
- And provides specialized UX validation and acceptance criteria
- And integrates seamlessly with core workflow

### Epic 5: Production Acceleration
**As a** team needing rapid deployment  
**I want** quality-assured rapid deployment assistance  
**So that** I can go to production quickly without compromising quality

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a need for rapid production deployment
- When Production Readiness Helper is activated  
- Then it identifies and resolves deployment blockers
- And maintains quality standards throughout acceleration
- And provides go-live validation and monitoring
