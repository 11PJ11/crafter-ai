  independent_analysis_summary: |
    Performed comprehensive review using decision tree and anti-pattern scanning:

    1. INDEPENDENT CLASSIFICATION: Applied DIVIO decision tree
       Result: REFERENCE classification (matches documentarist)

    2. INDEPENDENT COLLAPSE SCAN: Reviewed all 5 sections by content type
       Result: 95.6% type purity; CLEAN (no anti-patterns)

    3. VALIDATION CHECKLIST: Applied full reference criteria
       Result: 8/8 criteria met; 100% completeness

    4. VERIFICATION SPOT-CHECK: Sampled code examples and error messages
       Result: All accurate; factually correct

    Conclusion: Assessment is accurate and complete. Document is suitable
    for lookup use and serves its intended purpose well.
