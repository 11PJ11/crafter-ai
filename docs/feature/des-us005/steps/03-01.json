  "description": "Implement suggestion formatting that includes all three components: 1) WHY: Educational explanation of failure cause and implications; 2) HOW: Specific steps to fix the issue; 3) Actionable: Command or file path to execute fix. Suggestion Format Example: 'The agent left GREEN_UNIT in IN_PROGRESS state, indicating it started but did not complete (typically due to unhandled error or timeout). To recover: Reset the phase status to NOT_EXECUTED by running: `/nw:execute @software-crafter steps/01-01.json`'. Formatting Guidelines: WHY: 1-2 sentences explaining failure cause; HOW: 1-2 sentences describing fix mechanism; Actionable: Specific command, path, or field reference; Total: 3-4 sentences per suggestion",
