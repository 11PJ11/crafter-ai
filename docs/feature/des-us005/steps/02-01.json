Detection Mechanism: Identify phases with status IN_PROGRESS after agent returns; Check completion_at is None (never finished); Extract phase name and position in execution log. Recovery Suggestions Generated: 1) WHY: Agent left phase IN_PROGRESS, indicating unhandled error or timeout; 2) HOW: Reset phase to NOT_EXECUTED for clean retry; 3) Actionable: /nw:execute command with step file path",
