  "description": "Implement detection for silent completions where agent returned without updating any phase status (all phases remain NOT_EXECUTED). Failure Mode: Agent completed but made no progress (all phases NOT_EXECUTED). Detection Mechanism: Check if task status is IN_PROGRESS but completed_at is set; Verify all phases remain NOT_EXECUTED; Identify mismatch: agent ran but no state changes. Recovery Suggestions Generated: 1) WHY: Agent completed without updating phase status, indicates missing OUTCOME_RECORDING; 2) HOW: Check agent transcript and manually update phase status based on evidence; 3) Actionable: Specific transcript path and verification instructions",
