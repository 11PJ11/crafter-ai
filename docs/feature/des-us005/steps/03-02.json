  "description": "Enhance crash recovery suggestions with specific transcript file path for debugging agent behavior. Implementation: Accept transcript_path parameter in recovery suggestion generation; Include path in at least one WHY suggestion (evidence of error); Format as actionable reference: 'Check agent transcript at {path}'. Example: 'Check agent transcript at /tmp/transcripts/session-12345.log for specific error details that prevented phase completion.' Integration Points: SubagentStop hook receives transcript_path; Pass to RecoveryGuidanceHandler.handle_failure(); Persist path reference in step file for future reference",
