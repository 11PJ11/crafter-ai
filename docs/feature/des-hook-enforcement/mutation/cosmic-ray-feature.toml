# Commit-Based Mutation Testing Configuration
# Approach: Hexagonal Architecture Compatible (files extracted from execution-status.yaml)
#
# Implementation files are extracted from execution-status.yaml → files_modified.implementation
# Tests are NOT mutated but executed to validate the implementation
#
# Usage:
#   .venv-mutation/bin/cosmic-ray init cosmic-ray-feature.toml session.sqlite
#   .venv-mutation/bin/cosmic-ray exec cosmic-ray-feature.toml session.sqlite
#   .venv-mutation/bin/cr-report session.sqlite
