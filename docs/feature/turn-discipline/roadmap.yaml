    ROADMAP REVIEW RESULTS: REJECTED - REVISION REQUIRED

    POSITIVE FINDINGS:
    ✓ Step-to-scenario mapping PERFECT: 12 feature steps map to 12 test scenarios
    ✓ Dependency graph VALID: No circular dependencies, all dependencies exist
    ✓ GIVEN/WHEN/THEN format COMPLETE: All 23 steps have proper acceptance criteria
    ✓ Dependency chain SOUND: Valid DAG structure enabling sequential execution
    ✓ Phase sequencing LOGICAL: Foundation → Validation → Completeness → Exclusions → Monitoring → Integration
    ✓ Infrastructure steps JUSTIFIED: 11 supporting steps clearly identified (schema, counter, monitor, tests)
    ✓ Parallel execution ANALYZED: Documentation shows Phase 02/05 can run in parallel after Phase 01
    ✓ Quality gates WELL-DEFINED: Coverage, complexity, regression, and performance targets specified

    CRITICAL REJECTIONS (MUST FIX):

    1. EFFORT ESTIMATION ISSUES (6 steps at 1 hour each):
       - 02-02: Add turn budget (50 turns) - currently 1h, should be 2-3h
         Reason: Requires template modification, test data setup, multiple assertion patterns
       - 02-05: Add turn count logging instruction - currently 1h, should be 2h
         Reason: Requires template logic, phase tracking integration, documentation
       - 03-02: Add TIMEOUT_INSTRUCTION to /nw:develop - currently 1h, should be 2h
         Reason: Requires command-specific rendering logic, dual-path testing
       - 04-01: Exclude TIMEOUT_INSTRUCTION from ad-hoc tasks - currently 1h, should be 2h
         Reason: Requires context detection logic, integration testing, edge cases
       - 04-02: Exclude TIMEOUT_INSTRUCTION from /nw:research - currently 1h, should be 2h
         Reason: Requires command routing logic, test setup, context propagation
       - 06-04: Create timeout warnings guide - currently 1h, should be 2h
         Reason: Documentation requires detailed examples, troubleshooting, agent training material

    2. TOTAL HOUR DISCREPANCY:
       - Stated total: 48-56 hours
       - Actual total: 44 hours
       - Gap: 4-12 hours below stated range
       - Root cause: Six feature steps at 1 hour (should be 2-4 hours minimum)
       - Correction needed: Adjust 1-hour steps to 2 hours each (+6 hours = 50 total hours)

    ACTION ITEMS FOR APPROVAL:
    1. Update step estimates for all 6 single-hour feature steps to minimum 2 hours
    2. Verify total hours align with 48-56 range (should be 50 hours after adjustment)
    3. Ensure acceptance criteria still realistic at revised estimates
    4. Update phase duration_weeks if needed to maintain team velocity assumptions
    5. Resubmit roadmap with updated estimates and revised validation.status = "approved"

    SECONDARY OBSERVATIONS (NON-BLOCKING):
    - Documentation steps (06-03, 06-04, 06-05) have realistic estimates
    - Infrastructure steps (01-01 through 01-04, 05-01, 05-02) are appropriately sized
    - Dependencies form clear sequential path with good parallelization opportunities
    - Acceptance criteria are testable and measurable for all feature scenarios

    RECOMMENDATION:
    Roadmap has sound structure and clear execution path. Effort estimation is the only
    blocker. Adjust single-hour feature steps to 2 hours minimum, bringing total to ~50 hours
    (within 48-56 range), then resubmit for approval. All other validation items PASS.
