## What Was Removed

Each agent had a duplicate section added by the automated fix script:

```markdown
# Production Frameworks (YAML Format)

contract:
  inputs:
    required:
      - type: "user_request"
        format: "Natural language command"
  outputs:
    primary:
      - type: "artifacts"
        examples: ["requirements.md"]
  side_effects:
    allowed: ["File creation/modification"]
    forbidden: ["Deletion without approval"]

safety_framework:
  input_validation:
    - schema_validation: "..."
    - content_sanitization: "..."
  # ... (109 lines total)
```

This section was a simplified duplicate of the comprehensive frameworks already present earlier in each file (around lines 604-900).

---

## What Was Retained

Each agent still has the **comprehensive production frameworks** with detailed examples:

1. **Contract Framework** (~50 lines)
   - Detailed input/output contracts
   - Side effects documentation
   - Error handling strategies

2. **Safety Framework** (~150 lines)
   - 4 validation layers with examples
   - 7 enterprise security layers
   - Misevolution detection
   - Agent-type-specific adaptations

3. **Testing Framework** (~200 lines)
   - Layer 1: Unit testing (agent-type-specific validation)
   - Layer 2: Integration testing (handoff validation)
   - Layer 3: Adversarial output validation (challenge validity)
   - Layer 4: Adversarial verification (peer review)

4. **Observability Framework** (~100 lines)
   - Structured JSON logging
   - Domain-specific metrics
   - Alerting thresholds
   - Dashboard specifications

5. **Error Recovery Framework** (~100 lines)
   - Retry strategies
   - Circuit breakers
   - Degraded mode operation
   - Agent-specific recovery patterns

**Total comprehensive framework content per agent**: ~600 lines

**Improvement**: Cleaner structure, no redundancy, easier maintenance.

## File Size Reduction

### Before Cleanup
- Total agent lines: ~16,361 lines
- Average agent size: ~1,487 lines

### After Cleanup
- Total agent lines: 15,162 lines
- Average agent size: ~1,378 lines

**Reduction**: 1,199 lines removed (7.3% reduction)

---

## Validation Results

### Duplicate Marker Check
```bash
grep -c "^# Production Frameworks (YAML Format)" 5d-wave/agents/*.md
```

**Result**: All agents return `0` (no duplicate markers found)

### Agent File Endings
All agents now end cleanly with:
- Quality gates
- Deployment status
- Template version
- Last updated date

No hanging duplicate framework sections.

---

## Tools Used

### 1. Remove Duplicate Frameworks Script
**File**: `/mnt/c/Repositories/Projects/ai-craft/scripts/remove-duplicate-frameworks.py`

**Method**: Split agent content at marker, keep only first part

```python
marker = "# Production Frameworks (YAML Format)"
parts = content.split(marker)
cleaned_content = parts[0].rstrip() + "\n"
```

**Execution**:
```bash
python3 scripts/remove-duplicate-frameworks.py
```

**Results**:
- ✅ 11/11 agents cleaned successfully
- 📉 1,199 total lines removed
- 🎉 All agents cleaned successfully!

---

## Conclusion

The duplicate framework cleanup operation was **successful**:

- ✅ All 11 affected agents cleaned
- ✅ 1,199 lines of duplicates removed
- ✅ Comprehensive frameworks retained
- ✅ Zero duplicate markers remaining
- ✅ Agent functionality preserved
- ✅ Cleaner, more maintainable codebase

All agents are now ready for the next phase: **adversarial verification workflow implementation** and **observability infrastructure deployment**.

**Report Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Operation**: Cleanup Complete
**Next Steps**: Priority 2 (Adversarial Verification) and Priority 3 (Observability)
