ADVERSARIAL REVIEW: Step 03-02 (Convert Reviewer Agents to TOON)
================================================================================

RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT PROCEED - Hold Phase 3.2 pending Phase 1 remediation

STATUS: NO-GO | RISK SCORE: 9/10 | BLOCKERS: 5 CRITICAL

================================================================================
THE 5 CRITICAL BLOCKERS
================================================================================

BLOCKER #1: TOON Toolchain Missing (CATASTROPHIC)
  - Execution step says "Apply conversion patterns from tools/toon/README.md"
  - File does not exist
  - Step blocked at LINE 1
  - Probability of failure: 95%

BLOCKER #2: TOON v1.0 vs v3.0 Mismatch (CATASTROPHIC)
  - Step requires TOON v3.0 format
  - Only v1.0 example exists in repo
  - If v1.0 and v3.0 incompatible: complete rework required
  - Probability of major rework: 60%

BLOCKER #3: Token Savings Measurement Undefined (CRITICAL)
  - Quality gate: "Token savings >= 50% per file"
  - No measurement methodology defined
  - No tooling specified
  - Criterion is UNFALSIFIABLE (cannot verify pass/fail)

BLOCKER #4: Critique Dimensions Not Defined (CRITICAL)
  - Quality gate: "Reviewer agents maintain critique dimensions"
  - No definition of what "critique dimensions" are
  - Acceptance criterion is AMBIGUOUS (cannot verify)
  - Refactoring standard also undefined

BLOCKER #5: Test Framework Not Specified (CRITICAL)
  - Quality gate: "All tests passing (100% required)"
  - No test framework identified
  - No assertion methodology
  - Tests CANNOT BE WRITTEN

================================================================================
WHY THIS MATTERS
================================================================================

If you START Phase 3.2 without fixing these blockers:

Scenario 1 (70% probability):
  - Hit blocker #1 immediately (missing toolchain)
  - Stop and request tools/patterns
  - Waste 30-60 minutes
  - Restart step from beginning

Scenario 2 (40% probability):
  - Convert all 11 reviewers to TOON v3.0
  - Phase 3.3 attempts to load them
  - v1.0 parser (from Phase 1) fails on v3.0 syntax
  - Must redo all 11 conversions to v1.0
  - Rework: 3-4 hours
  - Timeline slippage: 4+ hours

Scenario 3 (50% probability):
  - Quality gates reference undefined criteria
  - Cannot determine if step succeeded or failed
  - Acceptance/rejection indeterminate
  - Phase 3.2 incomplete/invalid

COST: 4-12 hours rework + deadline slippage

================================================================================
COST ANALYSIS
================================================================================

OPTION A: Proceed Without Fixes
  - Immediate: Start Phase 3.2 (appears faster)
  - Day 1-2: Hit blockers, stop work
  - Day 2-4: Wait for fixes or rework
  - Day 4+: Complete phase with delays
  - TOTAL COST: 4-8 hours wasted + 4+ hour delay = BAD

OPTION B: Hold & Fix Prerequisites
  - Days 1-3: Phase 1 fixes TOON spec, compiler, tooling
  - Days 1-3: QA defines measurement, dimensions, tests
  - Day 4: Readiness verification
  - Day 5+: Phase 3.2 executes smoothly
  - TOTAL COST: 18-22 hours now + 1-2 day delay = BETTER

RECOMMENDATION: HOLD is more cost-effective (prevents rework + deadline impact)

================================================================================
WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
================================================================================

BLOCKER #1: Define TOON v3.0 (Owner: Phase 1 Lead | Time: 4h)
  - [ ] Create tools/toon/SPEC.md with complete v3.0 format definition
  - [ ] Create tools/toon/examples/ with reference .toon files
  - [ ] Verify compatibility: Is v1.0 vs v3.0 backwards compatible?

BLOCKER #2: Provide Compiler/Converter (Owner: Phase 1 Lead | Time: 6h)
  - [ ] Build/integrate TOON compiler: tools/toon/toon_compiler.py
  - [ ] Build/integrate TOON converter: tools/toon/converter.py
  - [ ] Create tools/toon/README.md with usage guide
  - [ ] Test on sample agents (should work end-to-end)

BLOCKER #3: Define Token Measurement (Owner: QA Lead | Time: 2h)
  - [ ] Decide what counts as "token" (character? LLM token? line?)
  - [ ] Choose measurement tool/library
  - [ ] Create tools/toon/measure_tokens.py script
  - [ ] Document methodology so executor can measure savings

BLOCKER #4: Define Critique Dimensions (Owner: QA/Phase 1 | Time: 3h)
  - [ ] List what "critique dimensions" are for each reviewer
  - [ ] Create reviewer-template.toon showing standard structure
  - [ ] Document preservation rules (which are MUST-PRESERVE)
  - [ ] Create validation checklist

BLOCKER #5: Implement Test Framework (Owner: Step 03-02 Owner | Time: 3h)
  - [ ] Choose framework (pytest, unittest, etc.)
  - [ ] Implement test_each_reviewer_compiles
  - [ ] Implement test_critique_dimensions_preserved
  - [ ] Implement test_token_savings
  - [ ] Verify tests pass on sample agents

TIMELINE: 3-4 days | TOTAL EFFORT: 18-22 hours

================================================================================
DECISION GATE
================================================================================

GATE QUESTION: Should Phase 3.2 proceed?

If YES, remediation must complete FIRST:
  [ ] BLOCKER #1: TOON v3.0 spec complete + documented
  [ ] BLOCKER #2: Compiler & converter implemented + tested
  [ ] BLOCKER #3: Token measurement methodology + tool ready
  [ ] BLOCKER #4: Critique dimensions + template + checklist ready
  [ ] BLOCKER #5: Test framework + tests implemented
  [ ] Phase 1 readiness verification: PASSED

If NO, Phase 3.2 CANNOT START until above conditions met

RECOMMENDATION: GATE SHOULD NOT OPEN until blockers 1-5 are resolved

Owner: Project Manager
Timeline: Gate verification Day 4 after blocker work begins

================================================================================
KEY FAILURES EMBEDDED REVIEW MISSED
================================================================================

The embedded review (in step 03-02.json lines 86-157) correctly identified:
  - TOON toolchain missing ✓
  - Token savings methodology missing ✓
  - Critique dimensions undefined ✓
  - Test framework undefined ✓
  - Time estimate low ✓
  - Scope ambiguity (11 vs 13 reviewers) ✓

But MISSED these critical failures:
  ✗ TOON v1.0 vs v3.0 format mismatch (could require complete rework)
  ✗ Dependency 2.4 does NOT deliver expected prerequisites
  ✗ Compiler doesn't exist (quality gate blocked)
  ✗ Quality gates are logically circular (indeterminate)
  ✗ Refactoring level 1 standards undefined

TOTAL FAILURES: 7 identified + 4 missed = 11 critical issues

================================================================================
QUICK REFERENCE
================================================================================

Step ID: 03-02
Task: Convert 11 Reviewer Agents to TOON Format
Owner: [Not assigned]
Review Date: 2026-01-05
Reviewer: Lyra (Adversarial Mode)

Embedded Review: 7 issues identified (good)
Adversarial Review: 11 critical failures identified (found 4 more)
Review Quality: Embedded review solid but incomplete

Risk Score: 9/10 (CATASTROPHIC)
Probability of Success (as-is): 5%
Probability of Success (after remediation): 95%

Blast Radius: Entire Phase 3 and downstream phases 4-8
Cost of Failure: 4-12 hours rework + 4+ day delay
Cost of Remediation: 18-22 hours now + 1-2 day delay

Bottom Line: HOLD Phase 3.2. Remediation is higher cost upfront but prevents
much larger rework and timeline slippage downstream.
