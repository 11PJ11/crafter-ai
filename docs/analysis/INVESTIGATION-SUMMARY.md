# CI/CD Investigation Summary

**Investigation Date**: 2026-01-21
**Time Spent**: Comprehensive 5-Whys Analysis
**Analyst**: Troubleshooter (Root Cause Analysis Specialist)

## The Problem You Reported

> "CI/CD is still failing despite recent fixes"
> "WebFetch showed recent runs as PASSED but you say it's still failing"

---

## What I Found

Your CI/CD is not actually failing in the traditional sense. **It's lying about success.**

The build script reports:
- `✅ Build completed successfully!`
- `Errors: 0`
- Exit code: 0

But also logs:
- `ERROR - Failed to parse YAML configuration`
- Multiple ERROR lines in build.log

This is a **discrepancy between reported status and actual failures**.

---

## The Root Cause (5-Whys Analysis)

### WHY #1: What's Observable?
Errors are logged but build succeeds

### WHY #2: Why Does That Happen?
YAML parsing error is caught and logged but not propagated upward

### WHY #3: Why Is Error Not Propagated?
Two separate error-handling paths: one catches exceptions locally, one only catches exceptions raised to top level

### WHY #4: Why Was System Designed This Way?
Mismatched error handling architecture: lower-level code catches and swallows exceptions, upper-level code only counts raised exceptions

### WHY #5: Why Does This Pattern Persist?
Fundamental issue: no clear error propagation contract; catch-all exception handling treats all errors as warnings to log and continue; no tests for build system itself

---

## Five Root Causes (All Present, All Required)

1. **YAML Syntax Error** - agent-builder.md line 773 has invalid YAML structure
2. **Silent Exception Swallowing** - agent_processor.py catches YAML errors but doesn't re-raise
3. **No Error Counter Increment** - build_ide_bundle.py can't count errors that don't reach its try/except
4. **Exit Code Decoupled from State** - sys.exit(0 if success else 1) depends on error counter that never increments
5. **No Artifact Validation** - Workflow accepts whatever build produces without verification

---

## Evidence

| Finding | Evidence | Location |
|---------|----------|----------|
| YAML Parse Error | `yaml.YAMLError` exception thrown | agent-builder.md:773 |
| Error Logged Not Raised | `logging.error()` then `return None` | agent_processor.py:57-59 |
| No Counter Increment | Exception caught locally, never reaches outer handler | build_ide_bundle.py:122 |
| stats["errors"] = 0 | Error counter never incremented despite ERROR logs | build.log |
| Exit Code Success | `sys.exit(0)` when stats["errors"] == 0 | build_ide_bundle.py:320 |
| Workflow Accepts | No validation after npm run build | ci.yml:43-47 |

---

## Why Previous Fixes Didn't Work

Commits `aa8cdb4`, `de4884a`, `92042d8` fixed symptoms but not root cause:
- `aa8cdb4`: Fixed specific YAML issues found then
- But didn't fix architecture (silent exception swallowing)
- New YAML error in agent-builder.md wasn't caught by old fixes
- No tests to prevent regression

Result: **False sense of security** from passing tests despite broken build system

---

## The Three-Part Problem

1. **Part 1: Silent Failures**
   - Exceptions caught at lower level
   - Not re-raised to be counted
   - Build continues as if nothing happened

2. **Part 2: False Metrics**
   - Error counter stays at 0
   - Build considers itself successful
   - Exit code is 0

3. **Part 3: No Detection**
   - Workflow doesn't verify build output
   - Incomplete/broken artifacts accepted
   - Downstream systems receive broken data

All three parts working together = false success signal

---

## What's Actually Broken

| What | Status | Evidence |
|-----|--------|----------|
| Tests | Pass ✓ | All 219 tests pass |
| Build Exit Code | False ✗ | Returns 0 despite failures |
| Artifacts | Incomplete ✗ | agent-builder fails to process |
| Error Reporting | Hidden ✗ | ERROR logs but exit 0 |
| Workflow | Accepts Anything ✗ | No downstream validation |

---

## Immediate Actions Needed

**CRITICAL (Do Now)**:
1. Fix YAML in agent-builder.md line 773
2. Make agent_processor.py re-raise exceptions instead of swallowing them

**HIGH (Do Next)**:
3. Verify error counter now works
4. Verify exit code now non-zero on build failures

**MEDIUM (Do After)**:
5. Add build artifact validation to workflow
6. Add tests: "Invalid YAML → Build fails"

**Prevention**:
7. Never accept exit code 0 as proof of success
8. Add validation: "Does dist/ have expected files?"
9. Add tests for build system itself, not just agents

---

## Files Affected

- `/mnt/c/Repositories/Projects/ai-craft/nWave/agents/agent-builder.md` (invalid YAML)
- `/mnt/c/Repositories/Projects/ai-craft/tools/processors/agent_processor.py` (swallows exceptions)
- `/mnt/c/Repositories/Projects/ai-craft/tools/core/build_ide_bundle.py` (error counter logic)
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (no validation)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Read the detailed analysis**:
   - `/mnt/c/Repositories/Projects/ai-craft/docs/analysis/root-cause-analysis.md`

2. **Review specific blockers**:
   - `/mnt/c/Repositories/Projects/ai-craft/docs/analysis/ci-cd-blockers.md`

3. **Implement fixes** in order (CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → Prevention)

4. **Verify each phase** using provided test commands

---

## Key Insight

Your system is **working as designed** (catching all errors and continuing), but the design itself is the problem. The build system prioritizes "resilience" (don't fail for one bad file) over "correctness" (fail if any required file is broken).

Result: You get a build that appears to succeed but contains hidden failures. This is worse than obvious failure because it's invisible.

**The fix requires changing the fundamental error handling contract**: errors must propagate, not be swallowed.

---

## Verification Commands

**See if build is currently broken**:
```bash
npm run build 2>&1 | grep -i error
# You'll see ERROR lines but exit code is 0
npm run build > /dev/null 2>&1; echo "Exit: $?"  # Shows: Exit: 0
```

**After fixes, this will be correct**:
```bash
npm run build > /dev/null 2>&1; echo "Exit: $?"  # Will show: Exit: 1 (failure)
```
