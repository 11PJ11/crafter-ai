reviewer_notes: |
  This documentation consolidation represents excellent quality work. The documentarist:

  1. Correctly identified and fixed genuine collapse patterns - The original 2-file hybrid
     monsters (40-45% purity) are now 5 properly-focused documents (92-98% purity)

  2. Implemented comprehensive quality gates - Pre-commit hooks, version tracking, and
     validation scripts are all in place

  3. Organized for user needs - DIVIO-based navigation guides users to exactly what they need

  4. Achieved excellent metrics - 92% type purity, zero broken links, 75 Flesch readability

  5. Documented thoroughly - FILE_INVENTORY.md and consolidation reports are clear and complete

  The project is well-positioned for users to find documentation easily and maintain
  consistency going forward.
