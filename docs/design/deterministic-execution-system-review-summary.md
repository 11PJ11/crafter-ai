## Review Panel

| Reviewer | Role | Verdict |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Morgan** | Solution Architect | CONDITIONALLY APPROVED |
| **Crafty** | Software Crafter | NEEDS WORK |
| **Sage** (PO) | Product Owner | BLOCKED (3/8 DoR) |
| **Sage** (Troubleshooter) | Failure Analyst | NOT READY (6 unmitigated risks) |

## Consensus: CRITICAL BLOCKERS

All four reviewers identified the same critical issue:

### BLOCKER #1: SubagentStop Hook Context Unknown

> **Q1 must be resolved before implementation can begin.**

- **Solution Architect:** "SubagentStop hook reliability is unverified - CRITICAL"
- **Software Crafter:** "Run a discovery hook to capture actual SubagentStop context"
- **Product Owner:** "Q1 is a blocker - marked 'To Research' but AC-4 (P0) depends on it"
- **Troubleshooter:** "SubagentStop hook may not fire at all if process dies"

**Required Action:** Create discovery test hook FIRST:
```python
# nWave/hooks/discover_subagent_context.py
import sys, json
from datetime import datetime

raw = sys.stdin.read()
with open(".git/subagent_context_discovery.log", "a") as f:
    f.write(json.dumps({
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "raw_length": len(raw),
        "sample": raw[:2000] if raw else "(empty)",
        "parsed_keys": list(json.loads(raw).keys()) if raw else []
    }) + "\n")
```

## Top 10 Required Changes (Prioritized)

### P0 - Must Fix Before Implementation

1. **Resolve Q1 empirically** - Test SubagentStop hook context with real invocation
2. **Verify Claude Code hook settings schema** - Confirm `SubagentStop` configuration works
3. **Add UAT scenarios** - 5-7 Given/When/Then covering happy path and failures
4. **Implement atomic file writes** - Prevent step file corruption
5. **Add external watchdog** - Detect orphaned IN_PROGRESS when process dies

### P1 - Must Fix During Implementation

6. **Single source of truth for phases** - Extract to `tdd_phases.yaml`
7. **Implement FSM guards** - Callable predicates, not just documentation
8. **Separate validation modules** - Split concerns for testability
9. **Store commit SHA in step file** - Detect git state divergence
10. **Add effort estimates** - Days per implementation phase

---

## Recommended Architectural Changes

### Change 1: Add Discovery Hook First (NEW)

Before implementing any validation, discover what SubagentStop actually provides:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SubagentStop": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "python nWave/hooks/discover_subagent_context.py"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

### Change 2: External Watchdog Process (NEW)

Add process that runs independently:

```python
# nWave/tools/execution_watchdog.py
def find_orphaned_executions(project_root, stale_threshold_minutes=30):
    """Find step files with IN_PROGRESS phases older than threshold."""
    # ... implementation from troubleshooter review
```

### Change 3: Atomic File Operations (UPDATED)

Replace all step file writes with:

```python
def save_step_file_atomic(path: str, data: dict):
    temp_path = path + ".tmp"
    backup_path = path + ".bak"

    with open(temp_path, "w") as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=2)

    # Validate before replacing
    with open(temp_path) as f:
        json.load(f)

    if Path(path).exists():
        shutil.copy(path, backup_path)

    os.rename(temp_path, path)
```

### Change 4: Single Phase Source of Truth (UPDATED)

```yaml
# nWave/data/config/tdd_phases.yaml
version: "1.0"
phases:
  - name: PREPARE
    index: 0
    gate: G1
    description: "Remove @skip tag, verify exactly 1 acceptance test active"
  # ... all 14 phases
```

All scripts import from this file.

### Change 5: YAML Frontmatter for Metadata (UPDATED)

Replace HTML comments with standard frontmatter:

```markdown
---
des:
  origin: "command:/nw:execute"
  step_file: "{step_file_path}"
  validation: required
  version: "1.0"
---

# AGENT_IDENTITY
...
```

---

## Missing UAT Scenarios (To Be Added)

### Scenario 1: Happy Path - Command Filtered and Validated

```gherkin
Given Marcus invokes /nw:execute @software-crafter "steps/01-01.json"
When DES processes the Task invocation
Then the prompt contains "<!-- DES-VALIDATION: required -->" marker
And pre-invocation validation checks all 14 TDD phases are embedded
And validation PASSES
And Task tool is invoked with validated prompt
```

### Scenario 2: Validation Failure - Missing TDD Phases

```gherkin
Given an orchestrator creates a Task prompt missing REFACTOR_L3 phase
When DES pre-invocation validation runs
Then validation FAILS with error "INCOMPLETE: TDD phase 'REFACTOR_L3' not mentioned"
And Task tool is NOT invoked
And orchestrator receives actionable error message
```

### Scenario 3: Post-Execution - Abandoned Phase Detected

```gherkin
Given a software-crafter agent completed work on step "01-01.json"
And phase GREEN_UNIT was left with status "IN_PROGRESS"
When SubagentStop hook fires
Then post-execution validation FAILS
And error "Phase GREEN_UNIT left IN_PROGRESS (abandoned)" is logged
And step file state is marked FAILED with recovery suggestions
```

### Scenario 4: Timeout - Agent Hits Turn Limit

```gherkin
Given a software-crafter agent is executing step "01-01.json"
And max_turns is set to 50
When agent reaches turn 50 without completing
Then agent saves partial progress to step file
And agent returns with status "PARTIAL_COMPLETION"
And remaining phases are documented in recovery_suggestions
```

### Scenario 5: Crash Recovery - Orphaned Execution

```gherkin
Given Marcus was running /nw:execute that crashed 45 minutes ago
And step file "01-01.json" has phase RED_UNIT with status "IN_PROGRESS"
When external watchdog runs with 30-minute threshold
Then orphaned execution is detected
And Marcus is notified "Orphaned execution: 01-01.json phase RED_UNIT stale for 45 minutes"
And recovery options are provided
```

## Open Questions Resolution Status

| Question | Status | Resolution |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Q1: Hook context contents | **BLOCKING** | Must test empirically |
| Q2: Parallel execution | Deferred | Sequential MVP accepted |
| Q3: Background agent monitoring | Deferred | Use TaskOutput polling |
| Q4: Token usage measurement | Deferred | Track post-implementation |
| Q5: Template inheritance | Rejected | Keep simple (no inheritance) |
