# AI-Craft Project Progress

## Project Overview
AI-Craft is an Outside-In Development project utilizing file-based pipeline workflows with specialized sub-agents for ATDD (Acceptance Test Driven Development) and comprehensive refactoring.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Infrastructure Complete - Ready for Feature Development
- **Last Updated**: 2025-01-13
- **Current Feature**: Pipeline Infrastructure Completed Successfully

## Architecture Overview
The project follows a five-stage ATDD cycle with file-based pipeline coordination:
1. **DISCUSS** - Requirements gathering with stakeholder collaboration
2. **ARCHITECT** - Collaborative architectural design with user input
3. **DISTILL** - Architecture-informed acceptance test creation
4. **DEVELOP** - Outside-in TDD with production service integration
5. **DEMO** - Stakeholder validation and comprehensive refactoring

## Pipeline Structure
All pipeline coordination happens through structured files in `docs/ai-craft/`:
- Input â†’ Agent â†’ Output pattern for optimal context management
- Resumable workflows at any stage
- Feature completion triggers comprehensive Level 1-6 refactoring

## Sub-Agent Network - âœ… IMPLEMENTED
11 specialized sub-agents coordinate the complete development workflow:

### Phase 1: Requirements & Architecture (4 agents)
1. **business-analyst** - Requirements gathering and stakeholder collaboration
2. **solution-architect** - Collaborative architectural design with user input
3. **technical-stakeholder** - Technical feasibility validation and constraint identification
4. **architecture-diagram-manager** - Visual architecture maintenance and evolution tracking

### Phase 2: Test Design & Development (3 agents)
5. **acceptance-designer** - Architecture-informed E2E test creation with Given-When-Then format
6. **test-first-developer** - Outside-in TDD with double-loop architecture and production service integration
7. **production-validator** - Production service integration validation and test infrastructure deception prevention

### Phase 3: Quality & Refactoring (2 agents)
8. **comprehensive-refactoring-specialist** - Complete Level 1-6 refactoring when feature acceptance tests pass
9. **technical-debt-tracker** - Technical debt identification, prioritization, and lifecycle management

### Phase 4: Validation & Orchestration (2 agents)
10. **quality-gates** - Comprehensive quality validation and commit readiness assessment
11. **atdd-orchestrator** - Pipeline coordination, feature completion management, and workflow orchestration

## Pipeline Files - âœ… IMPLEMENTED
Complete file-based pipeline infrastructure:

### Core Documentation
- `PROGRESS.md` - Main project progress and feature completion history
- `requirements.md` - Business requirements and acceptance criteria
- `architecture.md` - Architectural design and decision records
- `architecture-diagrams.md` - Visual architecture representations with evolution tracking

### Development Workflow
- `acceptance-tests.md` - E2E test scenarios with one-at-a-time management
- `development-plan.md` - Implementation planning and production service integration strategy
- `implementation-status.md` - Current development progress and test results
- `integration-status.md` - Production service integration validation

### Quality & Completion
- `refactoring-notes.md` - Progressive refactoring activities during development
- `comprehensive-refactoring-report.md` - Level 1-6 refactoring results at feature completion
- `technical-debt.md` - Technical debt registry with priority matrix and metrics
- `quality-report.md` - Comprehensive quality validation results

## Infrastructure Completed - âœ…
- **Pipeline Directory**: `docs/ai-craft/` with all templates
- **Agent Configurations**: `.claude/agents/` with all 11 specialized sub-agents
- **File Templates**: Complete input/output pipeline structure
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive agent specifications and workflows

## Next Steps
1. **Begin First Feature Development**: Ready to start ATDD cycle with real feature
2. **Test Complete Pipeline**: Validate end-to-end workflow with actual feature implementation  
3. **Validate Agent Collaboration**: Ensure proper handoffs between specialized agents
4. **Optimize Pipeline Flow**: Refine based on real-world usage patterns

## System Capabilities - âœ… READY
- **Resumable Workflows**: Can interrupt and resume at any pipeline stage
- **Context Optimization**: File-based input/output prevents context pollution
- **Architecture Evolution**: Automatic diagram updates and technical debt tracking
- **Comprehensive Refactoring**: Level 1-6 refactoring triggered by feature completion
- **Quality Enforcement**: Complete quality gates before commits
- **Production Integration**: Validated production service integration throughout development

## Metrics (Infrastructure Phase)
- **Sub-Agents Implemented**: 11/11 âœ…
- **Pipeline Files Created**: 12/12 âœ…
- **Agent Configurations**: 11/11 âœ…
- **Infrastructure Readiness**: 100% âœ…

## Architecture Evolution
Infrastructure implementation complete. Architecture evolution tracking will begin with first feature development.
