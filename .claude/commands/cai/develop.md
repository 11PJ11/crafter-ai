## Agent Flow
```yaml
test-first-developer:
  outer_loop_atdd:
    - Creates failing E2E acceptance test first (RED)
    - Represents user-facing feature from business perspective
    - Uses given().when().then() fluent API for business language
    - "Write the Code You Wish You Had" interface design

  inner_loop_utdd:
    - Steps down to unit test when E2E test fails
    - Creates failing unit test for smallest behavior (RED)
    - Implements minimal code to make unit test pass (GREEN)
    - Refactors continuously while keeping tests green (REFACTOR)
    - Returns to E2E test to verify progress

systematic-refactorer:
  continuous_refactoring:
    - Level 1-2 refactoring during each GREEN phase
    - Readability and complexity improvements
    - Domain-driven naming and clean code practices

```

## Arguments

### Basic Usage
```bash
/cai:develop [story-id]
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
/cai:develop [story-id] --outside-in --tdd-mode <mode> --one-scenario --validate
```

### Story Identification
- `[story-id]`: Specific story identifier (e.g., "STORY-AUTH-001")
- `@story-path`: Path to story file with embedded context
- `--epic [epic-id]`: Develop all stories within an epic

### TDD Methodology Control
- `--outside-in`: Enforce Outside-In TDD methodology (default)
  - Start with E2E acceptance tests representing user-facing features
  - Step down to unit tests when E2E tests fail (proper inner loop)
  - Focus on business behavior rather than technical implementation details
  - Ensure natural test progression from acceptance to unit level
- `--double-loop`: Explicit double-loop TDD architecture
  - Outer loop: ATDD/E2E tests for customer validation and business outcomes
  - Inner loop: Unit TDD for developer implementation and technical details
  - Systematic progression between loops with clear boundaries and responsibilities
  - Maintains business focus while enabling detailed technical implementation
- `--one-scenario`: Implement one E2E scenario at a time (recommended)
  - Prevents overwhelming NotImplementedException cascades during development
  - Enables clean commits with working implementation at each step
  - Maintains focus and reduces cognitive load for complex features
  - Follows proper Outside-In TDD scope management principles
- `--real-system`: Ensure step methods call production services
  - Prevents test infrastructure deception where tests pass without real implementation
  - Validates that step methods invoke actual production services via dependency injection
  - Ensures production code paths are exercised rather than test doubles
  - Critical for authentic ATDD implementation and production readiness

### Development Approach
- `--tdd-mode strict`: Strict REDâ†’GREENâ†’REFACTOR cycles with no shortcuts
  - Rigorous TDD with no production code without failing tests first
  - Enforces proper cycle discipline and prevents implementation shortcuts
  - Maximum learning and design benefits from TDD methodology
- `--tdd-mode guided`: Guided TDD with scaffolding support and education
  - Provides TDD mentoring and educational guidance throughout development
  - Includes explanations of TDD decisions and methodology benefits
  - Suitable for teams learning TDD or complex domain modeling
- `--tdd-mode natural`: Natural test progression without forcing artificial failures
  - Allows natural progression when tests would naturally fail
  - Balances TDD benefits with pragmatic development efficiency
  - Suitable for experienced TDD practitioners and well-understood domains

### Quality Control
- `--validate`: Add comprehensive validation steps throughout development
  - Validates step methods call production services not test infrastructure
  - Ensures architectural compliance and hexagonal boundaries
  - Applies quality gates at each development phase with rollback capability
  - Includes continuous validation of test quality and effectiveness
- `--mutation-testing`: Include mutation testing validation for test effectiveness
  - Validates test quality by introducing code mutations and checking test failures
  - Ensures tests actually validate business logic rather than implementation details
  - Achieves target kill rates (â‰¥75-80%) before considering development complete
  - Identifies weak tests and missing edge case coverage
- `--coverage [threshold]`: Set test coverage requirements with business focus
  - Sets minimum code coverage thresholds (default: 80% line, 90% branch)
  - Focuses on meaningful coverage of business logic paths
  - Excludes infrastructure and framework code from coverage requirements
  - Combines with mutation testing for comprehensive test quality assessment
- `--refactor-level [1-3]`: Specify refactoring intensity during development

## Outside-In TDD Process

### Double-Loop TDD Architecture
```yaml
outer_loop_atdd:
  description: "Customer perspective - business behavior validation"
  cycle: "E2E Test (RED) â†’ Implementation â†’ E2E Test (GREEN)"
  focus: "Business outcomes and user workflows"
  language: "Business-focused Given-When-Then scenarios"

inner_loop_utdd:
  description: "Developer perspective - technical implementation"
  cycle: "Unit Test (RED) â†’ Code (GREEN) â†’ Refactor"
  focus: "Technical implementation and design"
  language: "Technical behavior specification"
```

### Implementation Sequence
1. **ðŸ”´ Failing E2E Acceptance Test** (Outer Loop Start)
   - Create E2E test representing user-facing feature
   - Use business language and real system integration
   - Test MUST fail initially - acts as executable specification

2. **ðŸ”„ Inner Unit Test Loop** (Inner Loop)
   - Step down to unit test when E2E fails
   - Write failing unit test for smallest behavior
   - Implement minimal code to pass unit test
   - **Continuous Refactoring** during GREEN phase
   - Return to E2E test to check progress

3. **âœ… E2E Test Passes** (Outer Loop Complete)
   - E2E test passes naturally through implementation
   - Move to next E2E scenario (one at a time)

### ATDD Quality Gates
```yaml
e2e_test_requirements:
  - Must call actual production services via dependency injection
  - Must avoid test infrastructure deception
  - Must use business language in test scenarios
  - Must validate real system behavior, not mocks

step_method_requirements:
  - Must invoke production services: `_serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<T>()`
  - Must avoid direct test infrastructure calls for business logic
  - Must demonstrate production code path coverage
  - Must use NotImplementedException for unimplemented collaborators

scaffolding_patterns:
  - Use NotImplementedException with clear descriptions
  - Apply "Write the Code You Wish You Had" pattern
  - Create natural interfaces during test writing
  - Maintain implementation pressure through proper failures
```

## Story Context Integration

  rationale: "Maintains clean development workflow and prevents overwhelming failures"
  commit_safety: "Ensures commits always have passing tests"
```

### Test Quality Validation
- **Mutation Testing**: â‰¥75-80% kill rate for test effectiveness
- **Coverage Requirements**: â‰¥90% unit test coverage, â‰¥70% integration coverage
