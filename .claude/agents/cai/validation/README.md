# Agent Directive Enforcement & Quality Systems

This validation framework solves the critical issue of agent directive non-compliance discovered in our Toyota 5 Whys root cause analysis. The system implements active constraint validation, enhanced specifications, backup systems, and cognitive load management.

## üéØ Problem Solved

Our agents were violating their own explicit directives:
- **Acceptance Designer**: Called CLI instead of production services despite clear "MUST use GetRequiredService" directive
- **Test-First Developer**: Created disconnected unit tests despite "MUST connect to acceptance tests" directive
- **Installation Process**: Removed SuperClaude commands despite safe installation requirements

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Components

### 1. Enhanced Agent Specification Format (`agent-specification-template.md`)
**Addresses Root Cause**: Passive compliance architecture

**Key Features**:
- **MANDATORY_CONSTRAINTS** section with enforceable rules
- **VALIDATION_RULES** with specific patterns and regex
- **ENFORCEMENT_MECHANISM** with blocking behavior
- **REMEDIATION_GUIDANCE** with concrete examples
- **COGNITIVE_LOAD_MANAGEMENT** with attention allocation

**Example Implementation**:
```yaml
mandatory_constraints:
  production_service_calls:
    rule: "Step methods MUST call production services via GetRequiredService pattern"
    pattern: "_serviceProvider\\.GetRequiredService<[^>]+>\\(\\)"
    forbidden_patterns: ["execAsync", "CLI calls"]
    violation_severity: "CRITICAL"
```

### 2. Pre-Generation Validation Framework (`pre-generation-validator.md`)
**Addresses Root Cause**: No active enforcement during output generation

**Key Features**:
- **4-Stage Validation Pipeline**: Structure ‚Üí Pattern ‚Üí Constraint ‚Üí Compliance
- **Real-Time Blocking**: Prevents non-compliant outputs from being delivered
- **Specific Remediation**: Provides exact fix instructions with templates
- **Evidence-Based Violations**: Shows exact line numbers and code issues

**Validation Process**:
1. Load agent specification constraints
2. Parse and analyze agent output
3. Execute pattern matching validation
4. Block output if violations found
5. Provide specific remediation guidance

### 3. Comprehensive Backup System (`enhanced-backup-system.sh`)
**Addresses Root Cause**: Installation safety oversight

**Key Features**:
- **Pre-Installation Scanning**: Detects existing frameworks and configurations
- **Conflict Analysis**: Identifies potential framework conflicts
- **Comprehensive Backup**: Creates timestamped backups with manifests
- **Namespace Separation**: Implements `/sc/` vs `/cai/` command separation
- **Restoration Scripts**: Automated restoration with conflict resolution

**Usage**:
```bash
./scripts/enhanced-backup-system.sh backup     # Create backup before installation
./scripts/enhanced-backup-system.sh restore TIMESTAMP  # Restore from backup
./scripts/enhanced-backup-system.sh list      # Show available backups
```

### 4. Agent Output Validation Framework (`agent-output-validator.md`)
**Addresses Root Cause**: No systematic output validation

**Key Features**:
- **Real-Time Compliance Scoring**: Tracks specification adherence (0-100%)
- **Trend Analysis**: Monitors improvement or degradation over time
- **Violation Categorization**: CRITICAL ‚Üí HIGH ‚Üí MEDIUM priority levels
- **Feedback Loops**: Provides learning integration for behavior correction
- **Dashboard Integration**: Real-time monitoring and alerting

**Compliance Metrics**:
- Overall compliance score with trend analysis
- Constraint-specific breakdown (production services, business language, etc.)
- Violation patterns and improvement recommendations

### 5. Cognitive Load Management System (`cognitive-load-manager.md`)
**Addresses Root Cause**: Cognitive architecture oversight

**Key Features**:
- **Attention Allocation**: 30% minimum for constraint validation
- **Directive Simplification**: Maximum 3 critical constraints per agent
- **Staged Processing**: 4-stage cognitive architecture with constraint focus
- **Load Detection**: Monitors cognitive strain and triggers simplification
- **Template System**: Pre-validated constraint compliance templates

**Cognitive Architecture**:
```yaml
attention_allocation:
  constraint_validation: 30%  # Minimum allocation
  problem_analysis: 40%       # Core problem solving
  solution_generation: 20%    # Output creation
  meta_cognition: 10%        # Self-monitoring
```
