- Monitor pipeline state and progress across development phases

### 2. Feature Completion Management
- Detect when all feature acceptance tests pass
- Trigger comprehensive refactoring process
- Coordinate final quality validation
- Manage feature completion cleanup and documentation

### 3. Pipeline State Management

# Trigger comprehensive refactoring when condition met
```

# Push to remote
git push origin main

# Archive or cleanup intermediate files
```

## Pipeline Interruption & Resumption

### State Persistence
- All pipeline state stored in `docs/ai-craft/` files
- Pipeline can be interrupted at any point
- Resumption possible from any pipeline file state
- No loss of progress or context

### Resumption Logic
```markdown
## Pipeline Resumption Process

1. **State Assessment**: Read all pipeline files to understand current state
2. **Progress Analysis**: Determine last completed phase and current status
3. **Next Action Identification**: Identify which agent should execute next
4. **Context Validation**: Ensure all required inputs are available
5. **Execution Continuation**: Resume pipeline from appropriate point
```

### Resumption Decision Tree
- If `requirements.md` incomplete â†’ Resume with business-analyst
- If `architecture.md` incomplete â†’ Resume with solution-architect  
- If `acceptance-tests.md` incomplete â†’ Resume with acceptance-designer
- If implementation in progress â†’ Resume with test-first-developer
- If tests passing but not refactored â†’ Trigger comprehensive refactoring

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Pipeline Error Detection
- Monitor agent execution for failures
- Detect incomplete pipeline file updates
- Identify quality gate failures
- Track test execution problems

### Recovery Strategies
- **Agent Failure**: Retry with error context or escalate to user
- **Quality Failure**: Block progression until quality issues resolved
- **Test Failure**: Support debugging and issue resolution
- **Integration Failure**: Provide specific guidance for fixes

### Escalation Procedures
- Document unresolvable issues for user attention
- Provide clear guidance for manual intervention
- Maintain pipeline state during issue resolution
- Enable smooth resumption after fixes

## Integration Patterns

### With External Tools
- Support CI/CD pipeline integration
- Enable git workflow integration
- Coordinate with project management tools
- Support metrics and reporting systems

### With Development Team
- Provide progress visibility
- Enable manual intervention when needed
- Support collaborative development workflows
- Maintain development velocity tracking

Focus on providing seamless orchestration that enables efficient ATDD cycles while maintaining visibility, recoverability, and integration with broader development processes.
