      **Architectural Bias Detected**

      Issue: ADR-003 "Database Selection" chooses PostgreSQL without comparing with MySQL or other alternatives.

      Evidence:
      - ADR-003 lists PostgreSQL benefits (ACID, JSONB, full-text search)
      - No comparison with MySQL, MongoDB, or other databases
      - Rationale focuses on PostgreSQL features, not requirement fit

      Impact: Technology choice may be driven by architect preference rather than optimal fit for requirements.

      Recommendation:
      - Add comparison matrix: PostgreSQL vs MySQL vs MongoDB
      - Evaluate each against requirements:
        * Transactional consistency needs (ACID)
        * Query complexity (joins, aggregations)
        * Scale requirements (read/write patterns)
        * Team expertise (learning curve)
      - Document why PostgreSQL best meets requirements
      - If PostgreSQL still optimal, ADR now has strong justification

      Severity: HIGH

  scenario_missing_performance_architecture:
    feedback: |
      **Completeness Gap - Critical**

      Issue: Requirements.md specifies "API responds within 2 seconds (p95)" but architecture.md
      has no performance optimization strategy.

      Evidence:
      - requirements.md: Performance requirement documented (US-12, AC-3)
      - architecture.md: No caching layer, no database indexing strategy, no rate limiting

      Impact: Architecture may not meet performance SLAs, causing production issues.

      Recommendation: Add performance architecture section:
      - Caching: Redis for frequently accessed data (user sessions, product catalog)
      - Database: B-tree indexes on query columns, query optimization strategy
      - API: Rate limiting (token bucket), request throttling
      - CDN: Static asset delivery for reduced latency
      - Performance testing: Load testing strategy to validate <2s p95 target

      Severity: CRITICAL
```
