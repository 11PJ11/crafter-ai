error_recovery_framework:
  overview: |
    Production tool agents must handle creative workflow failures gracefully with retry strategies,
    circuit breakers, and degraded mode operation. Recovery patterns adapt to tool-specific
    outputs while maintaining consistent error handling.

  universal_principles:
    - "Fail fast for permanent errors (invalid delivery spec, missing locked audio)"
    - "Retry with backoff for transient errors (render timeouts, temporary resource issues)"
    - "Degrade gracefully when full functionality unavailable (partial storyboard, draft animatic)"
    - "Always communicate degraded state to user (missing shots, incomplete timing charts)"
    - "Preserve user work on failures (save partial renders, versioned source files)"
