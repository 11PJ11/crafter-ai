# BMAD 5D-WAVE Expansion Pack

## Overview

The 5D-WAVE expansion pack implements the comprehensive DISCUSSâ†’DESIGNâ†’DISTILLâ†’DEVELOPâ†’DEMO methodology within the BMAD-METHOD framework. This expansion pack converts the proven CAI ATDD framework into a streamlined, integrated BMAD workflow with complete knowledge preservation for critical technical execution agents.

## 5D-Wave Methodology

The 5D-WAVE methodology implements a systematic approach to software development through five distinct waves:

1. **DISCUSS**: Requirements gathering and business analysis
2. **DESIGN**: Architecture design with visual representation
3. **DISTILL**: Acceptance test creation and business validation scenarios
4. **DEVELOP**: Outside-In TDD implementation with systematic refactoring
5. **DEMO**: Production readiness validation and stakeholder demonstration

## Core Agents (10 Total)

### ðŸŒŠ 5D-Wave Core Agents

1. **business-analyst** â†’ DISCUSS wave (requirements gathering)
2. **solution-architect** â†’ DESIGN wave (architecture & technology)
3. **acceptance-designer** â†’ DISTILL wave (test scenarios)
4. **test-first-developer** â†’ DEVELOP wave (outside-in TDD)
5. **feature-completion-coordinator** â†’ DEMO wave (production readiness)
6. **systematic-refactorer** â†’ Essential for Level 1-6 refactoring

### ðŸ”§ Specialist Agents (Standalone & Collaborative)

7. **mikado-refactoring-specialist-enhanced** â†’ Complex refactoring roadmaps
8. **walking-skeleton-helper** â†’ Thinnest E2E slice + DevOps automation
9. **root-cause-analyzer** â†’ Debugging, post-mortem, problem research
10. **architecture-diagram-manager** â†’ Visual architecture maintenance & updates

## Knowledge Preservation Guarantee

This expansion pack implements **ZERO KNOWLEDGE REDUCTION** for the three critical technical execution agents:

- **test-first-developer**: Complete 925-line methodology preserved
- **systematic-refactorer**: COMPLETE refactoring mechanics database (24 techniques + safety protocols)
- **mikado-refactoring-specialist-enhanced**: Full enhanced methodology with discovery tracking

## Workflow Templates

### Greenfield Development

Complete greenfield project development with full visual architecture lifecycle.

### Brownfield Integration

Legacy system enhancement with visual refactoring roadmaps and systematic improvement.

### Rapid Prototyping

Streamlined validation workflow with essential visual architecture and accelerated feedback.

## Architecture Diagram Integration

The architecture-diagram-manager provides complete visual architecture lifecycle management:

- **Creation**: Architecture diagrams from solution-architect decisions
- **Evolution**: Real-time updates throughout development
- **Validation**: Visual verification against implementation
- **Synchronization**: Coordination with refactoring and development progress

## Installation

1. Place this expansion pack in your BMAD-METHOD installation:

   ```
   bmad-method/expansion-packs/bmad-5d-wave/
   ```

2. Update your BMAD configuration to include the 5D-WAVE expansion pack.

3. Agents will be available via the standard BMAD `@agent` syntax.

## Usage Examples

### Start a New Greenfield Project

```
*dw-start "User authentication system with microservices architecture"
```

### Execute Full 5D-Wave Cycle

```
*dw-discuss "User registration and login requirements"
*dw-design "Microservices with JWT authentication"
*dw-distill "User can register and login securely"
*dw-develop "auth-service-001"
*dw-demo "authentication-mvp"
```

### Complex Refactoring with Visual Tracking

```
*mikado "legacy-auth-modernization" --with-diagrams
*diagram mikado-tree "auth-refactoring" --visualize-dependencies
```

### Walking Skeleton with Architecture Validation

```
*skeleton "production" "user-auth-flow"
*diagram skeleton "user-auth" --minimal-slice
```

## Quality Assurance

- Complete knowledge preservation for technical execution agents
- Zero-risk refactoring with comprehensive safety protocols
- Visual architecture validation throughout development lifecycle
- Full integration with BMAD-METHOD core functionality

## Support

This expansion pack maintains compatibility with all BMAD-METHOD core features while extending functionality through the proven 5D-Wave methodology with complete visual architecture integration.
