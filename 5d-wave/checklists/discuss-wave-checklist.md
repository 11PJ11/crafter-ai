## ðŸ“Š **Success Metrics**

### Quantitative Measures

- **Stakeholder Engagement**: â‰¥90% attendance at key discussions
- **Requirements Coverage**: 100% of identified business capabilities covered
- **Acceptance Criteria**: â‰¥95% of user stories have complete Given-When-Then criteria
- **Risk Coverage**: 100% of identified risks have documented mitigation strategies

### Qualitative Measures

- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: High confidence in requirements understanding
- **Team Alignment**: Clear understanding of ATDD methodology and approach
- **Domain Clarity**: Consistent use of ubiquitous language across team
