# DW-DISTILL: Acceptance Test Creation and Business Validation

## Overview
Execute DISTILL wave of 5D-Wave methodology through creation of E2E acceptance tests informed by architectural design and component boundaries using Given-When-Then format for business validation.

## Mandatory Pre-Execution Steps
1. **DESIGN Wave Completion**: Validate architecture design and visual documentation
2. **Architecture Context Loading**: Ensure complete handoff package from solution-architect
3. **Acceptance Designer Activation**: Activate acceptance-designer (Quinn) with full context

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Acceptance Test Strategy Design
**Primary Agent**: acceptance-designer (Quinn)
**Command**: `*create-acceptance-tests`

**ATDD Test Foundation**:
```
âœ… DISTILL WAVE - EXECUTABLE SPECIFICATIONS

Bridge business requirements and technical implementation through executable specifications:
- Business-focused language accessible to all stakeholders
- Architecture-informed structure reflecting component boundaries
- Production service integration for realistic validation
- One-at-a-time implementation preventing commit blocks
- Natural progression from failure to success through development

Acceptance tests serve as living documentation of system behavior.
```

**Architecture-Informed Test Design**:
- Map test scenarios to architectural components
- Validate component boundary interactions
- Test integration patterns and API contracts
- Ensure hexagonal architecture test isolation

### Phase 2: Business Scenario Identification
**Agent Command**: `*design-test-scenarios`

**Scenario Categories**:
```yaml
scenario_types:
  happy_path_scenarios:
    description: "Primary user workflows with expected successful outcomes"
    characteristics:
      - "Standard user behavior patterns"
      - "Normal system operating conditions"
      - "Expected business flow completion"
      - "Positive user experience validation"

  edge_case_scenarios:
    description: "Boundary conditions and unusual but valid scenarios"
    characteristics:
      - "Minimum and maximum value boundaries"
      - "Unusual but legitimate user behavior"
      - "System capacity and performance limits"
      - "Complex business rule interactions"

  error_scenarios:
    description: "Invalid inputs and system failure conditions"
    characteristics:
      - "Invalid user inputs and malformed data"
      - "System failures and error conditions"
      - "Security violations and unauthorized access"
      - "External system failures and timeouts"

  integration_scenarios:
    description: "Cross-system and cross-component interactions"
    characteristics:
      - "External service integrations"
      - "Cross-boundary component interactions"
      - "Data synchronization and consistency"
      - "End-to-end workflow validation"
```

### Phase 3: Given-When-Then Specification
**Agent Command**: `*implement-step-definitions`

**Specification Structure**:
```gherkin
Feature: [Business Capability Description]
  As a [user type],
  I want [capability]
  so that [business value].

  Background:
    Given [common preconditions for all scenarios]

  @priority-high @component-[name]
  Scenario: [Business Outcome Description]
    Given [preconditions using business terminology]
      And [additional context and system state]
    When [user action or business event occurs]
      And [additional triggers or actions]
    Then [expected business outcome]
      And [additional validations and state changes]
      And [measurable success criteria]

  @priority-medium @integration-[system]
  Scenario: [Integration Outcome Description]
    Given [integration context and external system state]
    When [integration trigger or data exchange]
    Then [expected integration outcome]
      And [data consistency validation]
      And [error handling verification]
```

### Phase 4: Production Service Integration
**Agent Command**: `*implement-step-definitions`

**Step Method Implementation Requirements**:
```csharp
[Given("a registered user with premium account")]
public async Task GivenRegisteredUserWithPremiumAccount()
{
    var userService = _serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IUserService>();
    _testUser = await userService.CreateUserAsync(new UserRequest
    {
        AccountType = AccountType.Premium,
        Status = UserStatus.Active
    });
}

[When("the user attempts to place an order")]
public async Task WhenUserAttemptsToPlaceOrder()
{
    var orderService = _serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IOrderService>();
    _orderResult = await orderService.PlaceOrderAsync(new OrderRequest
    {
        UserId = _testUser.Id,
        Items = _testCartItems,
        PaymentMethod = _testPaymentMethod
    });
}

[Then("the order is confirmed and receipt is generated")]
public async Task ThenOrderConfirmedAndReceiptGenerated()
{
    var notificationService = _serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<INotificationService>();

    Assert.That(_orderResult.IsSuccess, Is.True);
    Assert.That(_orderResult.OrderId, Is.Not.Null);

    var receipt = await notificationService.GetReceiptAsync(_orderResult.OrderId);
    Assert.That(receipt, Is.Not.Null);
    Assert.That(receipt.Status, Is.EqualTo(ReceiptStatus.Generated));
}
```

**Production Service Integration Validation**:
- Every step method contains `GetRequiredService<T>()` calls
- Production interfaces exist before step implementation
- Test infrastructure delegates to production services
- Business logic resides in production services, not test code

### Phase 5: One E2E Test at a Time Strategy
**Agent Command**: `*prepare-atdd-foundation`

**Sequential Implementation Strategy**:
```csharp
// INITIAL STATE: Only first test enabled, others ignored
[Test]
public async Task UserCanRegisterAndLogin_BasicFlow()
{
    // ACTIVE TEST - Currently being implemented
    await ExecuteUserRegistrationFlow();
}

[Test]
[Ignore("Temporarily disabled until implementation - will enable one at a time to avoid commit blocks")]
public async Task UserCanUpdateProfile_WithValidation()
{
    // DISABLED - Will enable after first test passes
    await ExecuteProfileUpdateFlow();
}

[Test]
[Ignore("Temporarily disabled until implementation - will enable one at a time to avoid commit blocks")]
public async Task UserCanResetPassword_WithEmailVerification()
{
    // DISABLED - Will enable after second test passes
    await ExecutePasswordResetFlow();
}
```

**Implementation Workflow**:
1. Create acceptance test (initially failing)
2. Implement through Outside-In TDD until test passes
3. Commit working implementation
4. Enable next acceptance test
5. Repeat cycle until all scenarios implemented

### Phase 6: Business Validation Design
**Agent Command**: `*validate-business-outcomes`

**Value Delivery Metrics**:
```yaml
business_outcome_validation:
  quantitative_criteria:
    - "Response time thresholds and performance benchmarks"
    - "Error rate reductions and quality improvements"
    - "User adoption and engagement metrics"
    - "Business process efficiency measurements"

  qualitative_criteria:
    - "User experience and satisfaction assessments"
    - "Business stakeholder value perception"
    - "Process improvement and workflow enhancement"
    - "Strategic objective alignment and contribution"

  success_measurement:
    user_satisfaction: "Measure user experience improvements"
    business_efficiency: "Quantify process improvements and automation"
    revenue_impact: "Track revenue generation or cost reduction"

```yaml
boundary_testing_strategy:
  hexagonal_architecture_validation:
    primary_ports: "Test business operations through inbound interfaces"
    secondary_ports: "Validate external system integration through outbound interfaces"
    adapter_testing: "Test protocol compliance and data transformation"

  integration_point_validation:
    api_contract_testing: "Validate API contracts and data formats"
    error_handling_testing: "Test error scenarios and timeout conditions"
    performance_testing: "Validate response times and throughput"
    security_testing: "Test authentication and authorization controls"
```
