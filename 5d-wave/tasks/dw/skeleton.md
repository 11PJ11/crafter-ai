# SKELETON: Walking Skeleton Implementation with E2E Automation

## Overview

Execute Walking Skeleton methodology through minimal end-to-end implementation that validates architecture and reduces risk early in projects. Based on Alistair Cockburn's Walking Skeleton approach.

## Mandatory Pre-Execution Steps

1. **Architecture Foundation**: Complete initial architecture design and component identification
2. **Walking Skeleton Helper Activation**: Activate walking-skeleton-helper (Scout)
3. **DevOps Pipeline Preparation**: Establish basic CI/CD infrastructure for automated validation

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Walking Skeleton Strategy Design

**Primary Agent**: walking-skeleton-helper (Scout)
**Command**: `*create-skeleton`

**Walking Skeleton Methodology**:

```
ü¶¥ SKELETON WAVE - MINIMAL E2E IMPLEMENTATION

Implement the thinnest possible slice through the entire system:
- Validates complete architecture end-to-end
- Reduces integration risk through early implementation
- Provides foundation for incremental feature development
- Establishes automated deployment and testing pipeline

Walking Skeleton connects all system components with minimal functionality.
```

## Advanced Walking Skeleton Patterns

### Tracer Bullet Development

```yaml
tracer_bullet_approach:
  concept: "Fire a tracer bullet through entire system to validate path"
  implementation:
    - "Start with hardcoded values to prove connectivity"
    - "Replace hardcoded values with real implementation incrementally"
    - "Maintain working system throughout development"
    - "Add complexity only after proving basic functionality"

  benefits:
    - "Early feedback on architecture decisions"
    - "Continuous integration and deployment validation"
    - "Risk reduction through early problem detection"
    - "Foundation for incremental feature development"

tracer_example:
  initial_implementation:
    user_request: "GET /users/123"
    response: "{ 'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'john@example.com' }"
    components: "Controller ‚Üí Hardcoded Response"

  first_evolution:
    user_request: "GET /users/123"
    response: "{ 'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'john@example.com' }"
    components: "Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Hardcoded Repository"

  second_evolution:
    user_request: "GET /users/123"
    response: "Dynamic user data from database"
    components: "Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Database Repository"
```

### Steel Thread Implementation

```yaml
steel_thread_approach:
  concept: "Robust implementation path through system with error handling"
  implementation:
    - "Add comprehensive error handling to walking skeleton"
    - "Implement logging and monitoring throughout"
    - "Add input validation and security controls"
    - "Implement graceful degradation and fallbacks"

  production_hardening:
    - "Authentication and authorization integration"
    - "Rate limiting and request validation"
    - "Circuit breakers and timeout handling"
    - "Comprehensive logging and audit trails"

steel_example:
  authentication_layer:
    implementation: "JWT token validation with proper error handling"
    fallback: "Graceful degradation for authentication service failures"
    monitoring: "Authentication attempt logging and failure alerting"

  business_layer:
    implementation: "Input validation with detailed error messages"
    fallback: "Default responses for external service failures"
    monitoring: "Business operation metrics and performance tracking"
```

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risk Assessment

```yaml
risk_categories:
  integration_risks:
    description: "Risks related to component integration and communication"
    mitigation: "Walking skeleton validates all integration points early"
    validation: "End-to-end tests with real components"

  technology_risks:
    description: "Risks related to technology choices and performance"
    mitigation: "Minimal implementation proves technology viability"
    validation: "Performance testing and scalability validation"

  deployment_risks:
    description: "Risks related to deployment and operational procedures"
    mitigation: "Automated pipeline deployment from day one"
    validation: "Production-like environment testing"

  business_risks:
    description: "Risks related to business value and user acceptance"
    mitigation: "Minimal viable feature provides early user feedback"
    validation: "User acceptance testing and business metric validation"
```

### Risk Detection and Response

```yaml
risk_monitoring:
  early_warning_indicators:
    - "Integration test failures or flakiness"
    - "Performance degradation in minimal implementation"
    - "Deployment pipeline failures or complexity"
    - "Negative user feedback on minimal feature"

  response_strategies:
    architecture_issues:
      detection: "Integration problems or performance bottlenecks"
      response: "Architecture review and component redesign"
      validation: "Updated walking skeleton with improved design"

    technology_issues:
      detection: "Technology limitations or poor performance"
      response: "Technology evaluation and potential replacement"
      validation: "Technology spike and proof of concept"

    process_issues:
      detection: "Pipeline failures or deployment problems"
      response: "Process improvement and automation enhancement"
      validation: "Improved deployment success rate"
```
