    criteria: "Multiple files, levels 3-6, high complexity, architectural changes"
    approach: "Mikado Method with discovery-tracking and visual planning"
    tools: "Enhanced Mikado graph, parallel change patterns, staged execution"

  hybrid_approach:
    criteria: "Mixed complexity, partial architectural impact"

**Command**: `*refactor`

**Execution Strategy Based on Complexity**:

**For Simple Refactorings (Levels 1-2)**:

```yaml
immediate_execution:
  approach: "Direct application with real-time validation"
  process:
    - "Apply refactoring transformation"
    - "Run automated tests to ensure no regression"
    - "Validate code quality improvement metrics"
    - "Commit successful changes with descriptive messages"
  safety_measures:
    - "One refactoring at a time"
    - "Immediate rollback on test failures"
    - "Quality gate validation before commit"
```

**For Complex Refactorings (Levels 3-6)**:

```yaml
staged_execution:
  approach: "Parallel change pattern with staged migration"
  process:
    - "EXPAND: Create new structure alongside existing"
    - "MIGRATE: Gradually move consumers to new structure"
    - "CONTRACT: Remove old structure after migration complete"
  safety_measures:
    - "Both old and new structures work during migration"
    - "Progressive consumer migration with validation"
    - "Comprehensive testing at each stage"
```

### Phase 5: Quality Validation and Metrics

**Agent**: software-crafter (Crafty)
**Command**: `*quality-metrics`

**Validation Framework**:

    after_metrics: "Post-refactoring quality measurements"
    improvement_analysis: "Quantitative improvement assessment"

  regression_testing:
    unit_tests: "All existing unit tests must pass"
    integration_tests: "System integration validation"
    acceptance_tests: "Business functionality verification"

  architectural_validation:
    design_principles: "SOLID principles compliance check"
