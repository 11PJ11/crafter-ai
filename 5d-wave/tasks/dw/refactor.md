# DW-REFACTOR: Systematic Code Analysis and Refactoring

**Wave**: CROSS_WAVE (continuous improvement support)
**Agent**: Crafty (software-crafter)
**Command**: `*refactor`

## Overview

Execute systematic refactoring of existing codebases through progressive code quality improvement, Mikado Method planning for complex refactorings, and six-level refactoring hierarchy implementation.

Progressive refactoring hierarchy: Readability (L1-2) → Structure (L3-4) → Design (L5-6) with continuous validation and automated quality gates.

## Context Files Required

- src/* - Codebase to analyze and refactor

## Previous Artifacts (Wave Handoff)

- Varies based on refactoring context

## Agent Invocation

@software-crafter

Execute *refactor for {target-class-or-module}.

**Context Files:**
- src/*

**Configuration:**
- level: 3  # Refactoring levels 1-6 (1=readability, 6=SOLID++)
- scope: module  # file/module/project
- method: extract  # extract/inline/rename/move
- mikado_planning: false  # Use Mikado Method for complex refactorings

## Success Criteria

Refer to Crafty's quality gates in 5d-wave/agents/software-crafter.md (Refactoring section).

**Key Validations:**
- [ ] Code quality metrics improved
- [ ] All tests passing after refactoring
- [ ] Refactoring levels applied systematically
- [ ] Technical debt reduced measurably
- [ ] Business naming and domain language consistent

## Next Wave
