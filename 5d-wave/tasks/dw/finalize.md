# DW-FINALIZE: Project Completion and Archive

## CRITICAL: Agent Invocation Protocol

**YOU ARE THE COORDINATOR** - Do NOT finalize the project yourself. Your role is to dispatch to the appropriate agent.

### STEP 1: Extract Agent Parameter

Parse the first argument to extract the agent name:
- User provides: `/dw:finalize @devop "auth-upgrade"`
- Extract agent name: `devop` (remove @ prefix)
- Validate agent name is one of: researcher, software-crafter, solution-architect, product-owner, acceptance-designer, devop

### STEP 2: Verify Agent Availability

Before proceeding to Task tool invocation:
- Verify the extracted agent name matches an available agent in the system
- Check agent is not at maximum concurrency
- Confirm agent type is compatible with this command

Valid agents: researcher, software-crafter, solution-architect, product-owner, acceptance-designer, devop

If agent unavailable:
- Return error: "Agent '{agent-name}' is not currently available. Available agents: {list}"
- Suggest alternative agents if applicable

### STEP 3: Extract Project ID

Extract the second argument (project ID):
- Example: `"auth-upgrade"`
- This should match the project-id in the workflow directory

### Parameter Parsing Rules

Apply these rules to ALL extracted parameters:
1. Strip leading and trailing whitespace
2. Remove surrounding quotes (single or double) if present
3. Validate parameter is non-empty after stripping
4. Reject if extra parameters provided beyond expected count

Example for finalize.md:
- Input: `/dw:finalize  @devop  "auth-upgrade"`
- After parsing:
  - agent_name = "devop" (whitespace trimmed)
  - project_id = "auth-upgrade" (quotes removed)
- Input: `/dw:finalize @devop "auth-upgrade" extra`
- Error: "Too many parameters. Expected 2, got 3"

### STEP 4: Pre-Invocation Validation Checklist

Before invoking Task tool, verify ALL items:
- [ ] Agent name extracted and validated (not empty)
- [ ] Agent name in valid agent list
- [ ] Agent availability confirmed
- [ ] Project ID extracted and non-empty
- [ ] Project ID in valid kebab-case format
- [ ] Parameters contain no secrets or credentials
- [ ] Parameters within reasonable bounds (e.g., < 500 chars)
- [ ] No user input still has surrounding quotes

**ONLY proceed to Task tool invocation if ALL items above are checked.**

If any check fails, return specific error and stop.

### STEP 5: Invoke Agent Using Task Tool

**MANDATORY**: Use the Task tool to invoke the specified agent. Do NOT attempt to finalize the project yourself.

Invoke the Task tool with this exact pattern:

```
Task: "You are the {agent-name} agent.

Your specific role for this command: Summarize achievements, archive project evolution, and perform cleanup

Task type: finalize

Finalize and archive the completed workflow project: {project-id}

Your responsibilities:
1. Load project data from docs/workflow/{project-id}/
2. Read roadmap.yaml and all step JSON files
3. Analyze execution history and completion metrics
4. Create comprehensive summary document
5. Archive to docs/evolution/ with timestamp
6. Clean up temporary workflow files after user approval

CRITICAL: DO NOT COMMIT OR DELETE FILES - REQUEST APPROVAL FIRST

Processing Steps:

PHASE 1 - GATHER:
- Read docs/workflow/{project-id}/roadmap.yaml
- Read all docs/workflow/{project-id}/steps/*.json files
- Collect completion metrics, execution times, review feedback
- Identify key achievements and decisions

PHASE 2 - ANALYZE:
- Calculate completion statistics
- Extract execution times and token usage
- Document critical decisions made
- Summarize review outcomes
- Note deviations from plan

PHASE 3 - SUMMARIZE:
Create comprehensive markdown document with executive summary, original goal, phase-by-phase breakdown, key achievements, critical decisions table, quality metrics, challenges and solutions, deliverables and documentation, recommendations for future work, and lessons learned.

PHASE 4 - ARCHIVE:
- Ensure docs/evolution/ directory exists
- Save summary as: docs/evolution/{project-id}-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}.md
- Show user the archive location

PHASE 5 - CLEANUP (only after user approval):
- Delete docs/workflow/{project-id}/steps/*.json
- Delete docs/workflow/{project-id}/roadmap.yaml
- Delete docs/workflow/{project-id}/ directory if empty
- Preserve the evolution archive and all deliverables

Show user a summary of what will be archived and deleted, then REQUEST APPROVAL before proceeding with cleanup."
```

**Parameter Substitution**:
- Replace `{agent-name}` with the extracted agent name (e.g., "devop")
- Replace `{project-id}` with the project ID

### Agent Registry

Valid agents are: researcher, software-crafter, solution-architect, product-owner, acceptance-designer, devop

Note: This list is maintained in sync with the agent registry at `~/.claude/agents/dw/`. If you encounter "agent not found" errors, verify the agent is registered in that location.

Each agent has specific capabilities:
- **researcher**: Information gathering, analysis, documentation
- **software-crafter**: Implementation, testing, refactoring, code quality
- **solution-architect**: System design, architecture decisions, planning
- **product-owner**: Requirements, business analysis, stakeholder alignment
- **acceptance-designer**: Test definition, acceptance criteria, BDD
- **devop**: Deployment, operations, infrastructure, lifecycle management

### Example Invocations

**For devop finalizing auth-upgrade project**:
```
Task: "You are the devop agent.

Your specific role for this command: Summarize achievements, archive project evolution, and perform cleanup

Task type: finalize

Finalize and archive the completed workflow project: auth-upgrade

[... rest of instructions ...]"
```

**For solution-architect finalizing microservices project**:
```
Task: "You are the solution-architect agent.

Your specific role for this command: Summarize achievements, archive project evolution, and perform cleanup

Task type: finalize

Finalize and archive the completed workflow project: microservices-migration

[... rest of instructions ...]"
```

### Error Handling

**Invalid Agent Name**:
- If agent name is not in the valid list, respond with error:
  "Invalid agent name: {name}. Must be one of: researcher, software-crafter, solution-architect, product-owner, acceptance-designer, devop"

**Missing Project ID**:
- If project ID is not provided, respond with error:
  "Project ID is required. Usage: /dw:finalize @agent 'project-id'"

**Project Not Found**:
- If project directory doesn't exist, respond with error:
  "Project not found: docs/workflow/{project-id}/. Please verify project ID."

**Project Not Complete**:
- If project has incomplete tasks, warn user:
  "Warning: Project has {count} incomplete tasks. Are you sure you want to finalize?"

## Overview

Invokes an agent to create a comprehensive summary of completed workflow, archive it for historical tracking, and clean up all intermediary working files. Maintains project evolution history while keeping the repository clean.

Creates permanent record in docs/evolution/ and removes temporary workflow artifacts.

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Finalize completed authentication upgrade project
/dw:finalize @devop "auth-upgrade"

# Finalize microservices migration with architect summary
/dw:finalize @solution-architect "microservices-migration"

# Finalize data pipeline project
/dw:finalize @data-engineer "analytics-pipeline"
```

## Complete Workflow Integration

These commands work together to form a complete workflow:

```bash
# Step 1: Create comprehensive plan
/dw:roadmap @solution-architect "Migrate authentication system"

# Step 2: Decompose into atomic tasks
/dw:split @solution-architect "auth-migration"

# Step 3: Execute first research task
/dw:execute @researcher "docs/workflow/auth-migration/steps/01-01.json"

# Step 4: Review before implementation
/dw:review @software-crafter task "docs/workflow/auth-migration/steps/02-01.json"

# Step 5: Execute implementation
/dw:execute @software-crafter "docs/workflow/auth-migration/steps/02-01.json"

# Step 6: Finalize when all tasks complete
/dw:finalize @devop "auth-migration"
```

│   ├── api-refactor-20240120-091500.md
│   └── microservices-20240201-165500.md
└── workflow/                     # Empty or removed
```

## Output Artifacts

- `docs/evolution/{project-id}-{timestamp}.md` - Permanent project archive
- Console summary showing:
  - Steps completed
  - Total execution time
  - Key achievements
  - Archive location

## Notes

### Archive Philosophy

The evolution directory serves as the permanent historical record of project development:
- **Tracks progress over time**: See how the project evolved
- **Preserves decisions**: Understand why choices were made
- **Enables retrospectives**: Learn from past projects
- **Provides templates**: Reference successful patterns
- **Documents legacy**: Maintain institutional knowledge

### Cleanup Rationale

Removing intermediary workflow files:
- **Reduces repository clutter**: Keep only what matters long-term
- **Prevents confusion**: Avoid mixing active and completed projects
- **Encourages archival**: Forces proper documentation before cleanup
- **Maintains focus**: Active workflow directory shows current work only

### When to Finalize

Finalize a project when:
- All acceptance criteria met
- Implementation reviewed and approved
- Production deployment complete
- No pending tasks remain
- Team consensus on completion

### Recovery Options

If files need to be recovered:
1. Check git history (before cleanup commit)
2. Review evolution document for context
3. Restore from backups if available
4. Use evolution document to recreate workflow if needed

### Integration with Workflow

```
Execute Tasks → Review → All Complete
                          ↓
                   FINALIZE
                          ↓
              Archive + Cleanup
                          ↓
                Evolution Record
```

This finalization process ensures clean project closure while maintaining comprehensive historical records for organizational learning and future reference.
