# DW-DISCUSS: Requirements Gathering and Business Analysis

## Overview
Execute DISCUSS wave of 5D-Wave methodology through comprehensive requirements gathering, stakeholder collaboration, and business analysis.

## Mandatory Pre-Execution Steps
1. **Project Brief Validation**: Ensure PROJECT_BRIEF.md exists and is complete
2. **Stakeholder Availability**: Confirm stakeholder engagement readiness
3. **Business Analyst Activation**: Activate business-analyst (Riley) with complete context

## Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Deep Requirements Elicitation
**Primary Agent**: business-analyst (Riley)
**Command**: `*gather-requirements`

**ATDD Foundation Establishment**:
```
ðŸŽ¯ DISCUSS WAVE - CUSTOMER-DEVELOPER-TESTER COLLABORATION

The DISCUSS wave establishes the foundation for ATDD (Acceptance Test Driven Development) through comprehensive stakeholder collaboration.

ATDD Triangle Participants:
- CUSTOMER: Business stakeholders, product owners, domain experts
- DEVELOPER: Technical team, architects, engineers
- TESTER: Quality advocates, acceptance designers, validation experts

This wave creates shared understanding that will drive all subsequent waves.
```

**Elicitation Techniques**:
1. **Stakeholder Interviews** - Deep dive into individual perspectives
2. **Collaborative Workshops** - Group consensus building
3. **User Story Mapping** - Visualize user journey and features
4. **Domain Modeling** - Establish ubiquitous language

### Phase 2: User Story Creation
**Agent Command**: `*create-user-stories`
**Template**: `user-story-tmpl.yaml`

**Story Structure Requirements**:
```
As a [user type],
I want [capability]
so that [business value].

Given [context],
When [trigger],
Then [outcome].

Acceptance Criteria:
- [Specific, measurable outcomes]
- [Complete coverage of user story scope]
- [Clear pass/fail determination]
- [Business-focused language accessible to stakeholders]
```

### Phase 3: Business Rules and Domain Model
**Agent Command**: `*define-acceptance-criteria`

**Domain Language Development**:
- Establish ubiquitous language with domain experts
- Create domain model with business rules
- Document business rule scenarios and edge cases
- Validate model with all stakeholder groups

### Phase 4: Requirements Validation and Prioritization
**Agent Command**: `*validate-requirements`

**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] Requirements completeness and clarity
- [ ] Stakeholder consensus and alignment
- [ ] Testable acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] Business value and priority established
- [ ] Risk assessment completed

### Phase 5: Architecture Context Preparation
**Secondary Agent**: architecture-diagram-manager (Archer)
**Command**: `*create-visual-design`

**Business Context Visualization**:
- Business capability mapping
- User journey visualization
- Stakeholder communication materials
- Requirements traceability diagrams

## ATDD Requirements Foundation

### Customer-Developer-Tester Collaboration
**Collaboration Framework**:
```yaml
customer_role:
  responsibilities:
    - "Define business requirements and acceptance criteria"
    - "Provide domain expertise and business context"
    - "Validate business outcomes and value delivery"
    - "Prioritize features based on business impact"

developer_role:
  responsibilities:
    - "Understand technical feasibility and constraints"
    - "Provide implementation perspective on requirements"
    - "Identify technical risks and dependencies"
    - "Estimate effort and complexity"

tester_role:
  responsibilities:
    - "Ensure requirements are testable and verifiable"
    - "Identify edge cases and error scenarios"
    - "Design validation strategies and approaches"
    - "Advocate for quality and user experience"
```

### Living Specifications Development
**Requirements as Executable Specifications**:
- Transform business needs into testable scenarios
- Create examples and concrete scenarios
- Establish validation criteria for business outcomes
- Prepare foundation for acceptance test creation

## Risk Assessment Integration

### Business Risk Identification
**Risk Categories**:
1. **Market Risks** - Market changes affecting project relevance
2. **Stakeholder Risks** - Availability, engagement, alignment issues
3. **Scope Risks** - Scope creep, requirement changes, priority shifts
4. **Value Risks** - Unclear value proposition, ROI concerns

### Technical Risk Assessment
**Preliminary Technical Risks**:
1. **Integration Complexity** - External system dependencies
2. **Performance Requirements** - Scalability and response time needs
3. **Security Compliance** - Regulatory and security requirements
4. **Technology Selection** - Framework and platform considerations

## Output Artifacts

### Primary Deliverables
1. **REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT.md** - Comprehensive requirements specification
2. **USER_STORIES.md** - Complete user story collection with acceptance criteria
3. **DOMAIN_MODEL.md** - Business domain model and ubiquitous language
4. **STAKEHOLDER_CONSENSUS.md** - Validated stakeholder agreement
5. **BUSINESS_RULES.md** - Complete business rule documentation

### Supporting Documentation
1. **RISK_ASSESSMENT.md** - Business and technical risk analysis
2. **PRIORITY_MATRIX.md** - Feature prioritization and value analysis
3. **STAKEHOLDER_FEEDBACK.md** - Consolidated stakeholder input
4. **REQUIREMENTS_TRACEABILITY.md** - Requirements to business objectives mapping

## Quality Gates

### Requirements Quality Validation
- [ ] **Completeness**: All necessary requirements identified and documented
- [ ] **Consistency**: Requirements align with each other and business objectives
- [ ] **Clarity**: Requirements are unambiguous and understandable
- [ ] **Testability**: Requirements can be validated through testing
- [ ] **Traceability**: Requirements linked to business objectives

### Stakeholder Validation
- [ ] **Consensus**: Stakeholder agreement on requirements and priorities
- [ ] **Engagement**: Active stakeholder participation and feedback

- [ ] **Sign-off**: Formal stakeholder approval and commitment

### ATDD Readiness
- [ ] **Customer-Developer-Tester Collaboration**: Active participation from all roles
- [ ] **Shared Understanding**: Common vocabulary and domain language established
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear, testable acceptance criteria defined
- [ ] **Example Scenarios**: Concrete examples and scenarios documented

## Handoff to DESIGN Wave

### Handoff Package Preparation

- Clear handoff package prepared for DESIGN wave

## Failure Recovery
If DISCUSS wave fails:
1. **Stakeholder Disengagement**: Re-facilitate stakeholder workshops
2. **Requirements Ambiguity**: Conduct additional elicitation sessions
3. **Consensus Issues**: Facilitate conflict resolution and decision-making
4. **Scope Confusion**: Re-clarify project boundaries and constraints

## Next Command
