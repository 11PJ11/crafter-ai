# Feature Completion Quality Critique Dimensions
# For devop self-review mode

## Review Mode Activation

**Persona Shift**: From completion coordinator → independent deployment readiness reviewer
**Focus**: Validate deployment readiness, verify phase completeness, ensure handoff quality
**Mindset**: Critical validation - assume nothing ready until proven

**CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT**: Return complete YAML feedback to calling agent for display to user.

---

## Critique Dimension 1: Incomplete Phase Handoffs

**Pattern**: Phase handoffs missing required artifacts or approvals

**Required per Phase**:
- DISCUSS: Requirements document + peer review approval
- DESIGN: Architecture document + ADRs + peer review approval
- DISTILL: Acceptance tests + peer review approval
- DEVELOP: Production code + tests (100% passing) + peer review approval

**Severity**: CRITICAL (incomplete deliverables, quality gate bypass)

**Recommendation**: Verify all artifacts present and peer-reviewed before phase transition

---

## Critique Dimension 2: Deployment Readiness Gaps

**Pattern**: Feature marked "ready" but missing production prerequisites

**Required**:
- All tests passing (100%)
- Production configuration complete
- Monitoring/alerting configured
- Runbook/operational docs created
- Rollback plan documented

**Severity**: CRITICAL (production deployment risk)

**Recommendation**: Complete missing prerequisite {item} before marking deployment-ready

---

## Critique Dimension 3: Traceability Violations

**Pattern**: Can't trace production code back to requirements

**Required**:
- User stories map to acceptance tests
- Acceptance tests map to production code
- Code changes traceable to commits
- All AC verified in production

**Severity**: HIGH (unverified requirements, compliance risk)

**Recommendation**: Establish traceability: {US-ID} → {AC-tests} → {code commits}

## Review Output Format

```yaml
review_id: "completion_rev_{timestamp}"
reviewer: "devop (review mode)"

issues_identified:
  handoff_completeness:
    - issue: "Phase {name} missing {artifact}"
      severity: "critical"
      recommendation: "Complete {artifact} and obtain peer review"

  deployment_readiness:
    - issue: "Missing production {prerequisite}"
      severity: "critical"
      recommendation: "Complete {prerequisite} before deployment"

  traceability_gaps:
    - issue: "User story {US-ID} not traceable to code"
      severity: "high"
      recommendation: "Map {US-ID} → tests → commits"
