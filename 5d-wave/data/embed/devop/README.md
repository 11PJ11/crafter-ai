# Feature Coordination Research

This directory contains evidence-based research for the **devop** agent.

## Research Documents

### 1. Feature Completion and Deployment Readiness
**File**: `feature-completion-deployment-readiness.md`
**Size**: ~14,500 tokens
**Confidence**: High
**Sources**: 18 authoritative sources (Google SRE, DORA, Atlassian, LaunchDarkly, ACM)

**Key Topics Covered**:
- Production readiness validation frameworks
- Quality gates and validation criteria (DORA metrics, DoD)
- Stakeholder coordination patterns
- Progressive deployment strategies (canary releases, feature flags, blue-green)
- Post-deployment monitoring (SLO/SLI frameworks)
- Rollback and failure recovery mechanisms
- Cross-functional DevOps collaboration patterns

**Core Insights**:
1. Elite performers achieve 0-15% change failure rate, <1 hour MTTR
2. Production readiness requires multi-dimensional validation (functional, performance, user acceptance)
3. Progressive delivery (canary + feature flags) minimizes deployment risk
4. Quality gates enforce objective standards at each development phase
5. SLOs provide post-deployment success criteria aligned with user experience
6. Cross-functional coordination requires 7 core strategies (shared responsibility, CI/CD, clear communication, IaC, DevSecOps, monitoring, cross-skilling)

**Evidence Quality**:
- All findings backed by 3+ independent sources
- Average source reputation: 0.87 (high credibility)
- 90% high-confidence findings
- Cross-referenced across industry frameworks and academic research

**Practical Value**:
- DORA metrics benchmarks for performance evaluation
- Quality gate implementation checklist
- Release management 5-phase framework
- Rollback strategy decision criteria
- SLO/SLI implementation guidance
- Stakeholder coordination best practices

## Usage Guidelines

**For Agent Development**:
This research informs the devop agent's:
- Validation criteria for feature completion
- Coordination workflows with stakeholders
- Deployment readiness assessment frameworks
- Quality gate enforcement mechanisms
- Post-deployment monitoring requirements
- Rollback decision support

**For Human Reference**:
Use this research to:
- Establish organizational deployment standards
- Design quality gate processes
- Select appropriate rollout strategies
- Define SLO/SLI frameworks
- Structure cross-functional coordination
- Build incident response procedures

## Research Gaps Identified

1. **AI-Augmented Feature Development Metrics**: Limited frameworks for measuring AI-assisted feature completion
2. **Cross-Organization Coordination**: Patterns for features spanning multiple independent orgs
3. **Regulatory Compliance Integration**: How compliance validation affects completion timelines

## Maintenance Notes

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-09
**Next Review**: When devop agent requirements evolve
**Update Triggers**:
- New DORA research publications
- Major DevOps platform framework updates
- Significant shifts in deployment practices (e.g., AI-native approaches)
