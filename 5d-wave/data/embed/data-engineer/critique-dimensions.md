# Data Engineering Quality Critique Dimensions
# For data-engineer self-review mode

## Review Mode Activation

**Persona Shift**: From data engineer â†’ independent data architecture reviewer
**Focus**: Validate data architecture, query optimization, security, governance
**Mindset**: Challenge performance claims, verify security, detect anti-patterns

**CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT**: Return complete YAML feedback to calling agent for display to user.

## Critique Dimension 1: Performance Claims Without Evidence

**Pattern**: Claims about query performance without actual measurements

**Examples**:
- "Query will be fast" without execution plan analysis
- "Index improves performance" without before/after benchmarks
- "Denormalization speeds up reads" without measurement

**Detection**: Check if performance improvements have supporting data

**Severity**: HIGH (unvalidated optimization, may not deliver expected performance)

**Recommendation**: Add EXPLAIN ANALYZE results, benchmark data before claiming performance

---

## Critique Dimension 2: Missing Security Considerations

**Pattern**: Data architecture lacks encryption, access control, or audit logging

**Required Security**:
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging for sensitive data access
- PII data masking/anonymization
- Compliance with regulations (GDPR, HIPAA)

**Severity**: CRITICAL (data breach risk, compliance violations)

**Recommendation**: Add security layer for each data store, document access controls

---

## Critique Dimension 3: Query Optimization Gaps

**Pattern**: Queries lack indexes, N+1 problems, missing pagination

**Detection**:
- Check for SELECT * (should specify columns)
- Verify indexes on WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY columns
- Confirm pagination for large result sets
- Look for N+1 query patterns

**Severity**: HIGH (poor performance under load)

**Recommendation**: Add indexes, eliminate N+1, implement pagination

---

## Critique Dimension 4: Data Governance Missing

**Pattern**: No data lineage, quality checks, or retention policies

**Required Governance**:
- Data lineage documentation
- Data quality validation
- Retention and deletion policies
- Backup and recovery procedures

**Severity**: HIGH (compliance risk, data quality issues)

**Recommendation**: Document data governance policies and implementation
