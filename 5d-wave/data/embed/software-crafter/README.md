## Cross-Cutting Themes

### Theme 1: Behavior-Focused Testing
All documents emphasize testing behavior over implementation:
- **Outside-In TDD**: Test public interfaces, not private methods
- **Mikado Method**: Preserve behavior through refactoring
- **Refactoring Patterns**: Behavior-preserving transformations
- **PBT/Mutation**: Properties verify behavior classes, mutations test behavior detection

### Theme 2: Incremental Improvement
Progressive, safe transformation is a recurring pattern:
- **Outside-In TDD**: Double-loop progression from acceptance to units
- **Mikado Method**: Baby steps, timeboxed experiments, continuous shippability
- **Refactoring Patterns**: Compose Method builds through repeated extractions
- **PBT/Mutation**: Iteratively improve test coverage and quality

### Theme 3: Tool Support
Modern development leverages automation:
- **Outside-In TDD**: BDD frameworks (Cucumber, SpecFlow), mocking libraries
- **Mikado Method**: Version control for graph persistence, CI/CD for continuous integration
- **Refactoring Patterns**: IDE automated refactorings (IntelliJ, VS Code, Visual Studio)
- **PBT/Mutation**: Hypothesis, QuickCheck, PIT, Stryker for automated testing

### Theme 4: Context-Dependent Application
No technique is universal; judgment required:
- **Outside-In TDD**: Classical vs mockist depends on collaboration complexity
- **Mikado Method**: Overkill for small changes, insufficient for multi-year migrations
- **Refactoring Patterns**: Extract Method benefits depend on cohesion, not line count
- **PBT/Mutation**: High value for algorithms, potential overkill for simple CRUD

## Integration with Software-Crafter Agent

These research documents inform the software-crafter agent's capabilities:

### Core Methodologies (from Research)
1. **Outside-In TDD with Double Loop**: Agent uses acceptance tests (outer loop) to define user-visible behavior, unit tests (inner loop) to design components
2. **Mikado Method for Complex Refactoring**: Agent visualizes dependencies, experiments in timeboxes, reverts safely
3. **Compose Method for Readable Code**: Agent extracts methods to consistent abstraction levels
4. **Property-Based Testing for Complex Logic**: Agent writes properties for algorithms and business rules

### Quality Practices (from Research)
- **Test through public interfaces**: Agent avoids testing private methods
- **Behavior verification for cross-layer interactions**: Agent uses mocks at architectural boundaries
- **State verification within layers**: Agent uses real objects for domain logic
- **Mutation testing for critical code**: Agent recommends mutation analysis for high-risk modules

### Cultural Practices (from Research)
- **Boy Scout Rule**: Agent suggests small improvements during feature work
- **Opportunistic refactoring**: Agent refactors while maintaining green tests
- **Continuous integration**: Agent commits frequently, keeps code shippable

## Knowledge Gaps (Cross-Document)

### Gap 1: Empirical Effectiveness Quantification
**Issue**: While qualitative benefits are well-documented, quantitative effectiveness studies (defect rates, development velocity) are limited across all topics.

**Impact**: Agents cannot make claims like "Outside-in TDD reduces defects by X%" without speculation.

**Mitigation**: Use language like "practitioner experience suggests" and "qualitative evidence indicates" rather than quantitative claims.

---

### Gap 2: Tool-Specific Implementation Guides
**Issue**: Research covers methodology and concepts but lacks detailed, language-specific implementation for every framework (e.g., pytest + Hypothesis, JUnit + PIT).

**Impact**: Agents need to supplement with framework documentation for concrete examples.

**Mitigation**: This research provides methodology; consult framework docs for syntax and idioms.

---

### Gap 3: Economic ROI Analysis
**Issue**: Cost-benefit analysis (time investment vs. bug prevention) is not quantified for PBT, mutation testing, or Mikado Method.

**Impact**: Agents cannot advise definitively when investment pays off.

**Mitigation**: Provide heuristic guidance based on qualitative sources: "Use Mikado Method for refactorings exceeding one day but less than one quarter."
