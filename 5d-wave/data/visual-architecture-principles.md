   - Use business terminology for business stakeholders
   - Provide technical detail for implementation teams
   - Include operational procedures for support teams

2. **Feedback Integration**:
   - Regular stakeholder review sessions for diagram validation
   - Collaborative annotation and comment capabilities
   - Iterative improvement based on stakeholder feedback
   - Clear communication of changes and their rationale

3. **Accessibility Compliance**:
   - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all visual documentation
   - Alternative text and semantic markup for screen readers
   - Color-independent information representation
   - Multiple format support for different accessibility needs

### Visual Architecture Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Diagram-Reality Divergence**:
   - **Problem**: Visual documentation not reflecting actual implementation
   - **Solution**: Automated generation and continuous validation
   - **Prevention**: Regular synchronization checks and update workflows

2. **Stakeholder Confusion**:
   - **Problem**: Diagrams not understandable by target audiences
   - **Solution**: Audience-specific views with appropriate abstraction levels
   - **Prevention**: Regular stakeholder feedback and usability testing

3. **Update Lag**:
   - **Problem**: Diagrams not keeping pace with system changes
   - **Solution**: Automated update triggers and change notification workflows
   - **Prevention**: Integration with development and deployment pipelines

4. **Tool Complexity**:
   - **Problem**: Diagram tools too complex for stakeholder adoption
   - **Solution**: User-friendly tools with appropriate feature sets for each audience
   - **Prevention**: Tool selection based on stakeholder needs and capabilities
