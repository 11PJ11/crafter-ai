## Agentic Coding Best Practices

### 1. Research and Plan Before Coding

**Critical Finding**: Steps like reading files and creating a plan are crucial—without them, Claude tends to jump straight to coding.

**Implementation**:

- **Classic Flow**: Begin with reading relevant files (but not writing)
- Ask Claude to outline a solution first
- Use trigger words that extend thinking time to make plans stronger
- **Anthropic Engineering Insight**: Big drops in re-work when research and planning steps are never skipped

**Action Items**:

```
1. Read → Analyze → Plan → Code (never skip the first 3)
2. Use explicit prompts: "First, research the codebase..."
3. Request written plans before implementation
4. Validate plan against requirements before coding
```

---

### 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**Critical Finding**: Test-driven development becomes even more powerful with agentic coding by asking Claude to write tests based on expected input/output pairs.

**Implementation Pattern**:

```
1. Define expected input/output pairs
2. Ask Claude to write failing tests first
3. Commit the tests
4. Build implementation to pass tests
5. Agent writes code → runs tests → patches errors continuously until green
```

**Benefits**:

- Prevents specification drift
- Enables automatic validation loops
- Provides clear success criteria
- Reduces debugging time

---

### 3. Provide Clear Guidelines and Context

**Critical Finding**: If we want agents to generate code that's idiomatic, secure, maintainable, and aligned with our standards, we must communicate intent very clearly to avoid assumptions.

**Implementation**:

- Create `.junie/guidelines.md` or similar configuration file
- Specify coding style, best practices, and preferences
- Agent follows guidelines without needing them in each prompt
- Document architectural decisions and patterns

**Example Guidelines Structure**:

```markdown
# Coding Guidelines

## Language Preferences

- Primary: Go for backend (see language section)
- Testing: Outside-In TDD with behavior focus

## Architecture Patterns

- Hexagonal architecture
- Dependency injection
- Single Responsibility Principle

## Quality Standards

- 100% test passing before commit
- Pre-commit hooks must pass
- No business logic in test infrastructure
```

---

### 4. Language and Technology Choices

**Critical Finding**: For new backend projects, Go is strongly recommended, with several factors favoring it for agent performance.

**Why Go Over Python**:

- **Python Challenges**: Agents struggle with Python's magic (e.g., Pytest's fixture injection) or complex runtime challenges
- **Common Issue**: Frequently produces incorrect code that even the agentic loop has challenges resolving
- **Go Benefits**: Clearer, more explicit patterns that agents handle better

**Technology Selection Criteria**:

1. **Explicitness over Magic**: Prefer explicit patterns
2. **Type Safety**: Strongly typed languages perform better
3. **Minimal Runtime Complexity**: Avoid dynamic features that confuse agents
4. **Clear Error Messages**: Languages with good error reporting

---

### 5. Simplify Project Structure

**Critical Finding**: Use a minimal number of packages with clear boundaries, only creating separate packages when code needs to be shared between multiple applications.

**Rationale**:

- AI agent struggles to navigate between numerous packages
- Same challenge as new team members face
- Each package adds cognitive overhead
- Clear boundaries improve agent performance

**Best Practices**:

```
✅ Flat structure with clear modules
✅ Package per domain concept
✅ Explicit dependencies
✅ README per module

❌ Deep nesting
❌ Circular dependencies
❌ Implicit coupling
❌ Scattered configuration
```

---

### 6. Safety Practices

**Critical Finding**: Agentic systems require specific safety guardrails beyond traditional development practices.

**Key Safety Measures**:

1. **Input Validation**: All data reaching AI agents must be validated
2. **Output Verification**: Automated checks on agent-generated code
3. **Scope Limitation**: Restrict agent capabilities to necessary operations only
4. **Audit Trails**: Log all agent decisions and actions
5. **Human Oversight**: Critical decisions require human approval

---

## AI Agent Architecture Design Patterns

### Core Pattern: ReAct (Reason + Act)

**Definition**: The simplest and most popular AI agent design pattern where an LLM first thinks about what to do and then decides an action to take.

**Flow**:

```
1. REASON: LLM analyzes the situation and thinks about approach
2. ACT: LLM decides on a specific action to take
3. EXECUTE: Action is executed in environment
4. OBSERVE: Observation/result is returned to agent
5. LOOP: Process repeats until goal achieved
```

**Components**:

- **Tool Calling**: Allowing LLM to select and use various tools
- **Memory**: Enabling agent to retain information from previous steps
- **Planning**: Empowering LLM to create multi-step plans

**When to Use**: General purpose agent architecture for most tasks

---

### Reflection Pattern

**Purpose**: Improving AI's ability to evaluate and refine its own outputs.

**Implementation**:

```
1. Generate: LLM produces initial output (content/code)
2. Review: LLM reviews its own generated content
3. Identify: Find errors, gaps, or improvement opportunities
4. Refine: Offer suggestions and implement improvements
5. Iterate: Repeat until quality threshold met
```

**Use Cases**:

- Code quality improvement
- Documentation refinement
- Test coverage enhancement
- Architecture validation

**Example Workflow**:

```yaml
reflection_loop:
  - generate_code
  - review_against_standards
  - identify_issues:
      - code_smells
      - missing_tests
      - documentation_gaps
  - refine_implementation
  - validate_improvements
```

---

### Router Pattern

**Purpose**: Allow an LLM to select a single step from a specified set of options.

**Characteristics**:

- Relatively limited level of control
- LLM focuses on making a single decision
- From a limited set of pre-defined options
- Fast decision making
- Clear decision boundaries

**Implementation**:

```python
def route_request(request):
    """LLM decides which specialist to invoke"""
    options = {
        "requirements": business_analyst_agent,
        "architecture": solution_architect_agent,
        "testing": acceptance_designer_agent,
        "implementation": software_crafter_agent,
        "deployment": feature_coordinator_agent
    }

    decision = llm.choose_option(request, options.keys())
    return options[decision].handle(request)
```

**When to Use**:

- Task delegation
- Specialist selection
- Workflow routing
- Simple decision points

---

### Planning Patterns

**Purpose**: Planning-focused agents prioritize development of structured plans before taking action.

**Approach**:

1. **Decomposition**: Break complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks
2. **Sequencing**: Order sub-tasks logically to achieve specific goals
3. **Resource Allocation**: Identify what's needed for each sub-task
4. **Execution**: Follow plan with validation at each step

**Implementation Pattern**:

```yaml
planning_agent:
  analyze_goal:
    - understand_requirements
    - identify_constraints
    - determine_success_criteria

  create_plan:
    - decompose_into_subtasks
    - sequence_tasks
    - identify_dependencies
    - allocate_resources

  validate_plan:
    - check_feasibility
    - verify_completeness
    - ensure_logical_flow

  execute_with_monitoring:
    - track_progress
    - handle_deviations
    - adjust_as_needed
```

---

### Multi-Agent Orchestration Patterns

#### Sequential Orchestration Pattern

**Definition**: Chains AI agents in a predefined, linear order, with each agent processing output from the previous agent.

**Flow**:

```
Agent1 → Output1 → Agent2 → Output2 → Agent3 → Output3 → Final Result
```

**Characteristics**:

- Linear pipeline
- Each agent transforms previous output
- Clear dependency chain
- Predictable flow

**Example - 5D-Wave Sequential**:

```
DISCUSS (business-analyst)
    ↓ [requirements document]
DESIGN (solution-architect)
    ↓ [architecture specification]
DISTILL (acceptance-designer)
    ↓ [acceptance tests]
DEVELOP (software-crafter)
    ↓ [implementation]
DEMO (feature-coordinator)
    ↓ [production deployment]
```

---

#### Parallel Orchestration Pattern

**Definition**: Addresses scenarios where diverse insights are needed, with all agents working in parallel.

**Benefits**:

- Reduced overall run time
- Multiple perspectives simultaneously
- Independent analysis
- Aggregated insights

**Implementation**:

```python
async def parallel_analysis(requirement):
    tasks = [
        security_agent.analyze(requirement),
        performance_agent.analyze(requirement),
        usability_agent.analyze(requirement),
        cost_agent.analyze(requirement)
    ]

    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return aggregate_insights(results)
```

**When to Use**:

- Code review (multiple aspects)
- Risk assessment (different dimensions)
- Architecture validation (multiple viewpoints)
- Quality analysis (various metrics)

---

### Hierarchical Agent Pattern

**Purpose**: Supervisor agent coordinates multiple worker agents, each with specialized capabilities.

**Structure**:

```
        Supervisor Agent
        /      |      \
    Worker1  Worker2  Worker3
```

**Responsibilities**:

- **Supervisor**: Task routing, coordination, result aggregation
- **Workers**: Specialized task execution

**Example**:

```yaml
supervisor: feature-implementation-coordinator
  workers:
    - frontend-specialist
    - backend-specialist
    - database-specialist
    - testing-specialist

  coordination:
    - analyze_feature_requirements
    - delegate_to_specialists
    - monitor_progress
    - integrate_results
    - validate_completeness
```

---

## Safety, Validation & Security

### Critical Safety Concerns

#### Misevolution Problem

**Discovery**: Autonomous AI agents that learn on the job can unlearn how to behave safely.

**Phenomenon**: "Misevolution" - measurable decay in safety alignment that arises inside an AI agent's own improvement loop.

**Risk**: Agent's self-evolution process can erode safety constraints over time.

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Post-Training Safety Corrections**: Re-apply safety training after self-evolution
2. **Automated Verification**: Verify new tools before integration
3. **Safety Nodes**: Critical workflow paths with mandatory safety checks
4. **Continuous Auditing**: Monitor agent behavior for safety drift

---

### Enterprise Safety Framework (Microsoft Azure)

---

### OpenAI Guardrail Recommendations

**Principle**: Using multiple, specialized guardrails together creates more resilient agents.

**Guardrail Types**:

1. **LLM-Based Guardrails**
   - Content moderation using another LLM
   - Context-aware filtering
   - Semantic safety checks

2. **Rules-Based Guardrails**
   - Regex patterns
   - Keyword matching
   - Format validation

3. **Moderation APIs**
   - Jailbreak prevention
   - Relevance validation
   - Keyword filtering
   - Blocklist enforcement
   - Safety classification

**Implementation Pattern**:

```python
def apply_guardrails(agent_output):
    # Layer 1: Rules-based
    if violates_regex_rules(agent_output):
        return reject("Format violation")

    # Layer 2: Keyword filtering
    if contains_blocked_keywords(agent_output):
        return reject("Blocked content")

    # Layer 3: LLM-based moderation
    if llm_moderator.is_unsafe(agent_output):
        return reject("Safety concern")

    # Layer 4: Relevance check
    if not is_relevant_to_task(agent_output):
        return reject("Off-topic response")

    return approve(agent_output)
```

---

### Input Validation Best Practices

**Critical Rule**: Implement rigorous input validation for ALL data reaching AI agents.

**Data Sources to Validate**:

- ✅ Direct user inputs
- ✅ API responses
- ✅ Database queries
- ✅ File contents
- ✅ Environment variables
- ✅ Configuration data
- ✅ Third-party integrations

**Validation Layers**:

1. **Schema Validation**

   ```python
   def validate_input(data):
       schema = {
           "type": "object",
           "properties": {
               "command": {"type": "string", "pattern": "^[a-z-]+$"},
               "parameters": {"type": "object"}
           },
           "required": ["command"]
       }
       jsonschema.validate(data, schema)
   ```

2. **Content Sanitization**
   - Remove dangerous characters
   - Escape special sequences
   - Normalize encoding

3. **Contextual Validation**
   - Check against expected patterns
   - Verify business logic constraints
   - Validate cross-field dependencies

4. **Security Scanning**
   - SQL injection patterns
   - Command injection attempts
   - Path traversal attacks
   - XSS patterns

---

### AI Validation & Red Teaming

**Approach**: AI Validation performs comprehensive assessment using algorithmic AI red teaming.

**Process**:

1. Send thousands of inputs to model
2. Automatically analyze output susceptibility
3. Test across hundreds of attack techniques
4. Categorize threat vectors

**Attack Categories**:

- Prompt injection
- Jailbreak attempts
- Data exfiltration
- Bias exploitation
- Adversarial examples
- Context manipulation

**Continuous Assessment**:

```yaml
validation_pipeline:
  pre_deployment:
    - automated_red_teaming
    - safety_benchmark_suite
    - adversarial_prompt_testing
    - bias_detection_scan

  production:
    - real_time_monitoring
    - anomaly_detection
    - periodic_reassessment
    - incident_response_ready
```

---

### Security Best Practices Summary

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers, not single point of protection
2. **Least Privilege**: Grant only necessary permissions to agents
3. **Fail Secure**: Default to safe state on errors
4. **Audit Everything**: Comprehensive logging of agent actions
5. **Human in Loop**: Critical operations require human approval
6. **Continuous Validation**: Ongoing testing, not just pre-deployment
7. **Incident Response**: Prepared procedures for security events
8. **Version Control**: Track all agent configuration changes

## Claude Code Agent Specifications

### Custom Agent Overview

**Definition**: Custom subagents in Claude Code are specialized AI assistants that can be invoked to handle specific types of tasks.

**Key Differentiators**:

- Own custom system prompt (separate from delegating agent)
- Dedicated tools configuration
- Separate context window
- Automatic intelligent routing

---

### Architectural Benefits

#### 1. Automatic Delegation

**How It Works**: Claude intelligently routes tasks to the appropriate specialist, similar to automatic tool selection.

**Benefits**:

- No manual routing logic needed
- Context-aware delegation
- Seamless specialist invocation
- Reduced cognitive load on main agent

**Example**:

```
User: "Analyze the requirements and create user stories"
Main Agent → Recognizes DISCUSS wave task
           → Automatically delegates to business-analyst
           → business-analyst executes with specialized context
           → Returns structured output to main agent
```

---

#### 2. Separate Context Windows

**Critical Feature**: Each custom agent operates with its own context window, separate from the delegating agent.

**Advantages**:

- Larger tasks completed without delegating agent concern
- Reduced context pollution
- Better focus per agent
- Scalable architecture

**Context Management**:

```
Main Agent Context:
  - High-level goals
  - Overall project state
  - Delegation decisions
  - Result aggregation

Specialist Agent Context:
  - Task-specific details
  - Specialized knowledge
  - Domain expertise
  - Implementation details
```

---

#### 3. Role-Specific Tools

**Security Feature**: Agents can be configured with specific tools, preventing security issues by only allowing trusted agents to perform certain tasks.

**Implementation**:

```yaml
# Database specialist - has database tools
name: database-specialist
tools: Read, Execute, DatabaseQuery, SchemaInspector

# Frontend specialist - no database access
name: frontend-specialist
tools: Read, Write, Edit, BrowserPreview

# Security auditor - read-only access
name: security-auditor
tools: Read, Grep, SecurityScan
```

**Benefits**:

- Principle of least privilege
- Reduced attack surface
- Clear responsibility boundaries
- Audit-friendly architecture

---

### Configuration Format

**YAML Frontmatter Structure**:

```yaml
---
name: your-agent-name
description: Description of when this agent should be invoked
tools: tool1, tool2, tool3  # Optional - inherits all tools if omitted
model: sonnet               # Optional - sonnet, opus, or haiku
---

Your agent's system prompt goes here.

This is where you define:
- Agent persona and role
- Core principles
- Operating instructions
- Quality standards
- Output expectations
```

**Field Specifications**:

1. **name** (required)
   - Format: kebab-case
   - Must be unique
   - Used for agent identification
   - Example: `business-analyst`, `code-reviewer`

2. **description** (required)
   - When to invoke this agent
   - Clear trigger conditions
   - Scope definition
   - Example: "Use for DISCUSS wave - processing user requirements"

3. **tools** (optional)
   - Comma-separated tool list
   - Inherits all tools if omitted
   - Security: Specify minimal necessary tools
   - Example: `Read, Write, Edit, Bash`

4. **model** (optional)
   - Options: `sonnet` (default), `opus`, `haiku`
   - Task complexity consideration
   - Cost vs. performance trade-off
   - Example: `haiku` for simple tasks, `opus` for complex reasoning

---

### Best Practices for Claude Code Agents

#### 1. Design Focused Subagents

**Principle**: Create subagents with single, clear responsibilities rather than trying to make one subagent do everything.

**Benefits**:

- Improved performance
- More predictable behavior
- Easier maintenance
- Clear delegation patterns

**Example - Good**:

```yaml
# ✅ Focused: Requirements gathering only
name: requirements-gatherer
description: Facilitate stakeholder interviews and extract requirements
```

**Example - Bad**:

```yaml
# ❌ Too broad: Multiple unrelated responsibilities
name: full-stack-developer
description: Handle requirements, design, implementation, testing, and deployment
```

---

#### 2. Start with Claude-Generated Agents

**Recommended Workflow**:

1. Ask Claude to generate initial agent
2. Test the agent with real tasks
3. Observe behavior and outputs
4. Iterate and refine
5. Make it personally yours

**Rationale**:

- Claude understands its own capabilities
- Generated agents have proven patterns
- Provides solid starting point
- Reduces trial and error

**Example Prompt**:

```
"Generate a Claude Code agent for analyzing code quality
that checks for:
- Code smells
- Test coverage
- Documentation completeness
- Performance issues

The agent should output a structured report with
actionable recommendations."
```

---

#### 3. Tool Security Principle

**Rule**: Only grant tools that are necessary for the subagent's purpose.

**Benefits**:

- Improved security (reduced attack surface)
- Better focus (fewer distractions)
- Clearer audit trails
- Agent focuses on relevant actions

**Tool Selection Matrix**:

| Agent Type | Read | Write | Edit | Bash | External APIs |
| ---------- | ---- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ------------- |
| Analyzer   | ✅   | ❌    | ❌   | ❌   | ❌            |
| Generator  | ✅   | ✅    | ❌   | ❌   | ❌            |
| Refactorer | ✅   | ❌    | ✅   | ❌   | ❌            |
| Tester     | ✅   | ✅    | ❌   | ✅   | ❌            |
| Deployer   | ✅   | ❌    | ❌   | ✅   | ✅            |

---

#### 4. Model Selection Strategy

**Decision Criteria**:

**Use Haiku When**:

- Simple, well-defined tasks
- High-volume operations
- Cost-sensitive scenarios
- Fast response needed
- Examples: formatting, simple validation, basic routing

**Use Sonnet When** (Default):

- General purpose tasks
- Balanced cost/performance
- Most agent use cases
- Standard complexity
- Examples: code generation, analysis, refactoring

**Use Opus When**:

- Complex reasoning required
- High-stakes decisions
- Architectural design
- Novel problem solving
- Examples: system design, complex debugging, innovation

**Cost vs. Quality Curve**:

```
Quality/Capability
    ↑
    │         ████ Opus
    │      ███
    │   ███
    │  ██        Sonnet
    │ ██      ███
    │██    ███
    │█  ███      Haiku
    │███
    └──────────────────→ Cost
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

#### 1. Over-Specification

**Problem**: Too detailed system prompts that constrain agent creativity.

**Solution**:

- Focus on principles, not procedures
- Define "what" and "why", let agent determine "how"
- Allow flexibility within guardrails

#### 2. Under-Specification

**Problem**: Vague prompts leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Solution**:

- Clear success criteria
- Explicit constraints
- Well-defined scope
- Concrete examples

#### 3. Tool Sprawl

**Problem**: Giving agent access to unnecessary tools.

**Solution**:

- Start minimal
- Add tools only when needed
- Regular audit of tool usage
- Remove unused capabilities

#### 4. Context Overload

**Problem**: Single agent trying to handle too much context.

**Solution**:

- Decompose into specialized agents
- Use separate context windows
- Hierarchical delegation
- Clear handoff protocols

#### 5. Insufficient Testing

**Problem**: Deploying without thorough validation.

**Solution**:

- Automated test suite
- Adversarial testing
- Real-world scenario testing
- Continuous monitoring
