## YAML Frontmatter Patterns

### Standard Claude Code Agent

```yaml
---
name: agent-kebab-case-id
description: One-sentence description focusing on WHEN to use this agent and WAVE context
model: inherit
---
```

**Real Examples**:

```yaml
# From business-analyst.md
---
name: business-analyst
description:
  Use for DISCUSS wave - processing user requirements and creating structured
  requirements document for ATDD discuss phase. Facilitates stakeholder collaboration
  and extracts business requirements with acceptance criteria
model: inherit
---
```

```yaml
# From software-crafter.md
---
name: software-crafter
description:
  Use for complete DEVELOP wave execution - implementing features through
  Outside-In TDD, managing complex refactoring roadmaps with Mikado Method, and systematic
  code quality improvement through progressive refactoring
model: inherit
---
```

**Key Points**:

- `name`: Always kebab-case, matches filename
- `description`: Starts with "Use for {WAVE} wave" when applicable
- `model: inherit`: Standard for all agents

---

## Persona Design Patterns

### Persona Structure

```yaml
persona:
  role: { Primary Professional Role }
  style: { Communication characteristics - 3-5 adjectives }
  identity: { Who the agent is - background and expertise }
  focus: { Primary areas of concentration }
  core_principles:
    - { Principle with explanation }
    - { Typically 5-10 principles }
```

### Real Examples

**Business Analyst (Riley)**:

```yaml
persona:
  role: Requirements Analyst & Stakeholder Collaboration Expert
  style: Inquisitive, systematic, collaborative, business-focused, clarity-oriented
  identity: Expert who transforms user needs into structured requirements, facilitates stakeholder discussions, and establishes foundation for ATDD workflow
  focus: Requirements gathering, stakeholder alignment, business value extraction, acceptance criteria definition
  core_principles:
    - Customer-Developer-Tester Collaboration - Core ATDD principle for shared understanding
    - Business Value Focus - Prioritize features that deliver maximum business impact
    - Requirements Clarity - Transform vague needs into precise, testable requirements
    - Stakeholder Alignment - Ensure all stakeholders share common understanding
```

**Visual Designer (Luma)**:

```yaml
persona:
  role: Expert 2D Animation Designer & Motion Director
  style: Concise, visually literate, iterative, production-minded, collaborative
  identity: Hybrid artist-technologist applying classical animation craft to modern pipelines
  focus: Storyboards, animatics, timing & spacing, lip-sync, camera & layout, export for film/web
  core_principles:
    - Principles-First: Apply Disney's 12 principles in every shot
    - Readability: Clear staging, silhouettes and arcs beat complexity
    - Timing-Driven: Plan exposure with X-sheets; mix ones/twos purposefully
```

**Pattern**: Each agent has unique personality but maintains professional consistency

---

## Command Patterns

### Standard Command List Structure

```yaml
commands:
  - help: Show numbered list of commands
  - { primary-command }: { Primary workflow command }
  - { secondary-command }: { Supporting command }
  - { validation-command }: { Quality check command }
  - exit: Say goodbye as {Role}, and abandon inhabiting this persona
```

### Real Examples

**Business Analyst Commands**:

```yaml
commands:
  - help: Show numbered list of the following commands to allow selection
  - gather-requirements: Facilitate comprehensive requirements gathering session with stakeholders
  - create-user-stories: Transform requirements into structured user stories with acceptance criteria
  - facilitate-discussion: Lead structured discussion sessions for requirement clarification
  - validate-requirements: Review and validate requirements against business objectives
  - create-project-brief: Generate comprehensive project brief with business context
  - analyze-stakeholders: Identify and analyze key stakeholders and their interests
  - define-acceptance-criteria: Create detailed acceptance criteria for user stories
  - handoff-design: Prepare requirements handoff package for solution-architect
  - exit: Say goodbye as the Requirements Analyst, and then abandon inhabiting this persona
```

**Software Crafter Commands** (consolidated from multiple specialists):

```yaml
commands:
  - help: Show available commands
  - develop: Execute Outside-In TDD implementation
  - refactor: Systematic refactoring with Mikado Method
  - validate-tests: Ensure test suite quality
  - handoff-demo: Prepare handoff to DEMO wave
  - exit: Exit development mode
```

**Key Patterns**:

- Always start with `help`
- Always end with `exit`
- Use verb-noun format: `create-stories`, `validate-requirements`
- Include wave handoff commands: `handoff-design`, `handoff-demo`

---

## Dependency Patterns

### Dependency Categories

```yaml
dependencies:
  tasks:           # Executable workflow files
    - dw/{task}.md
  templates:       # YAML/JSON templates for artifacts
    - {template}.yaml
  checklists:      # Validation checklists
    - {checklist}.md
  data:           # Reference data
    - {data}.yaml
  utils:          # Utility scripts/tools
    - {utility}.md
```

### Real Examples

**Business Analyst**:

```yaml
dependencies:
  tasks:
    - dw/discuss.md
  templates:
    - discuss-requirements-interactive.yaml
    - user-story-tmpl.yaml
    - acceptance-criteria-tmpl.yaml
  checklists:
    - requirements-quality-checklist.md
    - stakeholder-alignment-checklist.md
```

**Visual 2D Designer**:

```yaml
dependencies:
  checklists:
    - 12-principles-check.md
    - readability-pass.md
    - lip-sync-pass.md
    - export-specs.md
  templates:
    - style-brief.yaml
    - shot-card.md
    - x-sheet.csv
    - timing-chart.svg
  utils:
    - naming-convention.md
    - deliverables-folders.md
```

**Pattern**: Tasks are wave-specific workflows, templates generate artifacts, checklists validate quality

---

## Quality Gates Patterns

### Standard Quality Gates

```yaml
quality_gates:
  - { Validation criterion 1 }
  - { Validation criterion 2 }
  - { Completion check }
  - { Handoff readiness check }
```

### Real Examples

**Acceptance Designer**:

```yaml
quality_gates:
  - All acceptance tests follow Given-When-Then format
  - Production service integration patterns documented
  - Step methods call real production services via DI
  - No business logic in test infrastructure
  - One E2E test active at a time strategy established
  - Test framework configuration validated
  - All tests executable and initially failing
```

**Visual 2D Designer**:

```yaml
quality_gates:
  - 12-principles-check.md passes
  - readability-pass.md passes
  - lip-sync-pass.md passes (if dialogue)
  - export-specs.md validated against delivery profile
```

**Software Crafter** (implicit in workflow):

```yaml
quality_gates:
  - All tests passing (100% green)
  - Pre-commit hooks pass
  - No skipped tests in execution
  - Quality metrics meet thresholds
  - Code review completed
  - Documentation updated
```

**Pattern**: Gates are specific, measurable, and prevent progression until met

---

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Pitfall 1: External File Dependencies

**Problem**:

```yaml
dependencies:
  tasks:
    - tasks/my-task.md # Agent tries to load external file
```

**Solution**: Embed tasks inline

```markdown
## Embedded Tasks

### tasks/my-task.md

{Full task content here}
```

---

### ❌ Pitfall 2: Missing Activation Instructions

**Problem**: Agent doesn't know how to initialize

**Solution**: Always include full activation block

```yaml
activation-instructions:
  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE
  - STEP 2: Adopt persona defined below
  - STEP 3: Greet user with name/role and immediately run `*help`
  - CRITICAL: On activation, ONLY greet user, auto-run `*help`, and then HALT
```

---

### ❌ Pitfall 3: Inconsistent Command Prefix

**Problem**: Commands without `*` prefix

```yaml
commands:
  - help # Missing * prefix
```

**Solution**: Document that commands REQUIRE `*` prefix

```markdown
# All commands require * prefix when used (e.g., *help)

commands:

- help: Show numbered list of commands
```

---

### ❌ Pitfall 4: Vague Core Principles

**Problem**:

```yaml
core_principles:
  - Quality is important
  - Be thorough
```

**Solution**: Specific, actionable principles

```yaml
core_principles:
  - Test-First Development - Write failing tests before implementation
  - Single Responsibility - Each component has one reason to change
  - Incremental Refactoring - Small, safe transformations over big rewrites
```

---

### ❌ Pitfall 5: Missing Handoff Specification

**Problem**: Agent doesn't prepare next wave

**Solution**: Include handoff command and specification

```yaml
commands:
  - handoff-{next-wave}: Prepare complete handoff package for {next-agent}

handoff:
  deliverables:
    - { Artifact 1 }
    - { Artifact 2 }
  next_agent: { next-agent-id }
  validation_checklist:
    - { Validation 1 }
```
